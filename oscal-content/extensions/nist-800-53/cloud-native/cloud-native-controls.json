Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of access control policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to access control policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.",

Unique Authorization Model\n\nIn cloud-native environments, access control operates at multiple layers:\n- Infrastructure layer (cloud provider IAM)\n- Orchestration layer (Kubernetes RBAC)\n- Service mesh layer (traffic policies)\n- Application layer (API gateway, service-to-service auth)\n\nThis multi-layered approach requires coordinated policies that don't conflict or create security gaps.\n\n### 2. Dynamic Environment Challenges\n\nCloud-native environments are highly dynamic, with containers scaling up and down, making traditional static access control models insufficient. Access control policies must account for:\n- Ephemeral workloads with short lifespans\n- Auto-scaling services that may run on different nodes\n- Dynamic service discovery and routing\n\n### 3. Zero Trust Architecture Approach\n\nCloud-native environments benefit from a zero trust approach where:\n- Every service-to-service communication requires authentication\n- Network location is not trusted as a security boundary\n- Least privilege is enforced at every level from infrastructure to application\n- Continuous verification replaces static credentials and long-lived sessions\n\n### 4. DevSecOps Workflow Integration\n\nAccess control in cloud-native environments should be:\n- Defined as code and stored in version control\n- Deployed through automated pipelines with security validation\n- Continuously monitored for drift and compliance\n- Updated through controlled change management processes\n\nAccess control policies should be treated as code artifacts with the same level of review, testing, and deployment rigor as application code."

Establish and implement a process for changing shared or group account authenticators (if deployed) when individuals are removed from the group; and\n l. Align account management processes with personnel termination and transfer processes.\n\nNIST Discussion:\nExamples of system account types include individual, shared, group, system, guest, anonymous, emergency, developer, temporary, and service. Identification of authorized system users and the specification of access privileges reflect the requirements in other controls in the security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on system accounts receive additional scrutiny by organizational personnel responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access, including system owner, mission or business owner, senior agency information security officer, or senior agency official for privacy. Types of accounts that organizations may wish to prohibit due to increased risk include shared, group, emergency, anonymous, temporary, and guest accounts.\n Where access involves personally identifiable information, security programs collaborate with the senior agency official for privacy to establish the specific conditions for group and role membership; specify authorized users, group and role membership, and access authorizations for each account; and create, adjust, or remove system accounts in accordance with organizational policies. Policies can include such information as account expiration dates or other factors that trigger the disabling of accounts. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, type of account, or a combination of the two. Examples of other attributes required for authorizing access include restrictions on time of day, day of week, and point of origin. In defining other system account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements and mission/business requirements. Failure to consider these factors could affect system availability.\n Temporary and emergency accounts are intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary accounts as part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation. Organizations establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with infrequently used accounts, including local logon accounts used for special tasks or when network resources are unavailable (may also be known as accounts of last resort). Such accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts include when shared/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no longer required and when individuals are transferred or terminated. Changing shared/group authenticators when members leave the group is intended to ensure that former group members do not retain access to the shared or group account. Some types of system accounts may require specialized training.",

          "notes": "## 1. Multi-Dimensional Account Management in Cloud-Native Environments\n\nCloud-native environments introduce a multi-dimensional approach to account management that differs significantly from traditional systems:\n\n- **Machine Identity Prominence**: Unlike traditional systems where human accounts dominate, cloud-native environments have a much higher ratio of service accounts to human accounts. These machine identities require different lifecycle management approaches.\n\n- **Ephemeral System Components**: The dynamic nature of containerized applications means that workloads may exist for minutes or hours rather than months or years. Account management must adapt to this ephemeral nature with short-lived credentials and dynamic provisioning.\n\n- **Identity Federation Complexity**: Cloud-native systems often span multiple trust domains (on-premises, multiple cloud providers, third-party services). This requires sophisticated identity federation mechanisms to maintain consistent access control.\n\n## 2. Architectural Impacts on Account Management\n\nMicroservices architecture fundamentally changes how account management must be implemented:\n\n- **Service Mesh vs. API Gateway Considerations**: Depending on whether authentication occurs primarily at the API gateway or is distributed through a service mesh affects how account management is implemented and audited.\n\n- **Stateless Authentication Requirements**: Microservices typically require stateless authentication mechanisms that don't rely on session storage, as services may be distributed across multiple nodes.\n\n- **Zero-Trust Architecture Alignment**: Cloud-native environments are well-suited for zero-trust security models where authentication and authorization occur for every service-to-service interaction, regardless of network location.\n\n## 3. DevOps Practices and Account Management\n\nThe operational model of cloud-native applications introduces unique account management challenges:\n\n- **GitOps and Configuration as Code**: Account management configurations are typically stored as code in version control systems, requiring robust review processes and protection against unauthorized changes.\n\n- **CI/CD Pipeline Security**: Automated deployment pipelines require privileged access to create, modify, and delete resources, making them high-value targets that need special protection.\n\n- **Developer Experience vs. Security**: There's an inherent tension between developer productivity (which favors broad permissions) and security requirements (which favor least privilege). Cloud-native environments require thoughtful solutions to this tension.\n\n## 4. Reconciling FedRAMP Requirements with Cloud-Native Practices\n\nSome traditional FedRAMP requirements need special consideration in cloud-native contexts:\n\n- **Periodic Account Review Challenges**: The volume and ephemeral nature of service accounts in cloud-native environments make traditional account review processes impractical. Automated approaches using analytics and anomaly detection are more appropriate.\n\n- **Delegation of Account Management**: FedRAMP typically requires centralized account management, but cloud-native environments often use delegated models where development teams manage service accounts within guardrails.\n\n- **Account Termination Timing**: Cloud-native automated scaling means services may be created and destroyed rapidly. Account termination requirements must be adapted to this dynamic environment.\n\n## 5. Cloud-Native Account Types Consideration\n\nCloud-native environments introduce several account types not typically addressed in traditional guidance:\n\n- **Workload Identities**: Modern cloud providers offer workload identity federation that allows pods or containers to authenticate as cloud identities without storing credentials.\n\n- **Short-lived, Automatically Rotated Credentials**: Many cloud-native authentication systems use credentials with extremely short lifespans (minutes to hours) that are automatically rotated, fundamentally changing how credential management is approached.\n\n- **Federated Machine Identities**: Service accounts in cloud-native environments are often federated across systems, requiring special consideration for account lifecycle management across trust boundaries."

Each layer requires specific controls appropriate to that layer's abstraction level (NIST SP 800-190).\n\n2. **Dynamic Environment Challenges**: The ephemeral nature of containers and dynamic scaling in cloud-native environments requires access control mechanisms that can handle rapidly changing resources while maintaining security integrity (CNCF Cloud Native Security Whitepaper).\n\n3. **Authentication vs. Authorization Distinction**: As noted in the CNCF Security Lexicon, \"Authentication is the first step of the process. Its aim is simple \u2013 to make sure the identity is who they say they are. Access control is the addition of environment constraints... Authorization defines the set of actions that the identity can perform after gaining access.\" Cloud-native implementations must address all three aspects.\n\n4. **Least Privilege Imperative**: Following the least privilege principle becomes even more critical in cloud-native environments due to the increased attack surface. As stated in the CNCF Security Lexicon, least privilege \"is the concept of only allowing the minimal amount of access necessary to perform a given function for the shortest duration possible, revoking permissions as necessary.\"\n\n5. **Security Policy as Code**: Cloud-native access enforcement benefits from expressing security policies as code, enabling automated validation, deployment, and monitoring. This approach makes access control more scalable, consistent, and maintainable across large environments (CNCF Cloud Native Security Lexicon).\n\n6. **Defense in Depth Strategy**: In Kubernetes environments specifically, implementing AC-3 requires a combination of RBAC, network policies, pod security contexts, and admission control to provide defense-in-depth for access enforcement (CONTROL_INDEX.md).\n\nBy implementing these cloud-native specific access enforcement controls, organizations can meet FedRAMP AC-3 requirements while maintaining the agility and scalability benefits of container-based architectures."

          "description": "Enforce approved authorizations for controlling the flow of information within the system and between connected systems based on [Assignment: organization-defined information flow control policies].\n\nNIST Discussion:\nInformation flow control regulates where information can travel within a system and between systems (in contrast to who is allowed to access the information) and without regard to subsequent accesses to that information. Flow control restrictions include blocking external traffic that claims to be from within the organization, keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, restricting web requests that are not from the internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based on data structures and content. Transferring information between organizations may require an agreement specifying how the information flow is enforced (see CA-3). Transferring information between systems in different security or privacy domains with different security or privacy policies introduces the risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security or privacy policies. In such situations, information owners/stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between connected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific architectural solutions to enforce specific security and privacy policies. Enforcement includes prohibiting information transfers between connected systems (i.e., allowing access only), verifying write permissions before accepting information from another security or privacy domain or connected system, employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows, and implementing trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security or privacy attributes and labels.\n Organizations commonly employ information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations within systems and between connected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path. Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict system services, provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or provide a message-filtering capability based on message content. Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering and/or inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement. Control enhancements 3 through 32 primarily address cross-domain solution needs that focus on more advanced filtering techniques, in-depth analysis, and stronger flow enforcement mechanisms implemented in cross-domain products, such as high-assurance guards. Such capabilities are generally not available in commercial off-the-shelf products. Information flow enforcement also applies to control plane traffic (e.g., routing and DNS).",

Due to the potential for denial of service, automatic lockouts initiated by systems are usually temporary and automatically release after a predetermined, organization-defined time period. If a delay algorithm is selected, organizations may employ different algorithms for different components of the system based on the capabilities of those components. Responses to unsuccessful logon attempts may be implemented at the operating system and the application levels. Organization-defined actions that may be taken when the number of allowed consecutive invalid logon attempts is exceeded include prompting the user to answer a secret question in addition to the username and password, invoking a lockdown mode with limited user capabilities (instead of full lockout), allowing users to only logon from specified Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, requiring a CAPTCHA to prevent automated attacks, or applying user profiles such as location, time of day, IP address, device, or Media Access Control (MAC) address. If automatic system lockout or execution of a delay algorithm is not implemented in support of the availability objective, organizations consider a combination of other actions to help prevent brute force attacks. In addition to the above, organizations can prompt users to respond to a secret question before the number of allowed unsuccessful logon attempts is exceeded. Automatically unlocking an account after a specified period of time is generally not permitted. However, exceptions may be required based on operational mission or need.",

Key Cloud-Native Challenges\n\n- **Diverse Access Points:** Cloud-native environments typically have multiple access interfaces (dashboards, APIs, registry UIs, terminal access), each requiring notification implementation.\n\n- **Ephemeral Resources:** Containers and resources may be short-lived, requiring banner implementation as part of infrastructure templates rather than manual configuration.\n\n- **Machine-to-Machine Communications:** Cloud-native systems often have extensive machine-to-machine interfaces that are exempt from banner requirements but must be properly documented in the SSP.\n\n### 2. Implementation Best Practices\n\n- **Centralized Banner Management:** Store notification text in a central location (ConfigMap, Secret) to ensure consistency and simplify updates across all components.\n\n- **Layered Approach:** Implement at both infrastructure (cloud provider console, Kubernetes) and application layers to ensure complete coverage.\n\n- **Automation:** Incorporate banner compliance checking into automated security scans and CI/CD pipelines for ongoing verification.\n\n### 3. Compliance Considerations\n\n- **Human vs. Machine Interfaces:** System use notifications are only required for human interfaces, not for machine-to-machine communications or automated API calls.\n\n- **Implementation Status Tracking:** Per FedRAMP guidance, if some parts of the control are implemented (e.g., part a - display notification) but others are still in progress (e.g., part b - retain notification until acknowledged), this must be clearly documented in the SSP.\n\n- **Public Services:** For publicly accessible systems, additional privacy accommodations may be required, particularly for systems that include monitoring or recording functionality.\n\n### 4. FedRAMP-Specific Notes\n\n- This control focuses primarily on application-level implementation rather than containerization-specific approaches.\n\n- While cloud-native technologies introduce new access interfaces, the fundamental requirements of AC-8 remain consistent: display appropriate notifications, require acknowledgment, and maintain special considerations for public systems."

Documentation Requirements\n\n- **Maintain Explicit Documentation**: Create and maintain a comprehensive registry of all endpoints that operate without authentication, including:\n  - Purpose of the endpoint\n  - Type of information exposed\n  - Business justification\n  - Risk assessment confirmation that no sensitive data is exposed\n  - Technical implementation details (path, port, etc.)\n\n- **Configuration as Code**: Implement all permitted actions without authentication as infrastructure-as-code to ensure consistent application and documentation:\n  ```yaml\n  apiVersion: v1\n  kind: ConfigMap\n  metadata:\n    name: unauthenticated-endpoints\n    annotations:\n      security.fedramp.gov/ac-14: \"true\"\n  data:\n    endpoints: |\n      - path: /healthz\n        port: 8080\n        rationale: \"Kubernetes liveness probe\"\n      - path: /metrics\n        port: 9090\n        rationale: \"Basic resource utilization metrics for scaling decisions\"\n  ```\n\n## 4. Service Mesh Implementation\n\n- **Use Granular Policy Definitions**: Implement service mesh technologies like Istio to define fine-grained access policies for all services, with explicit exceptions for unauthenticated actions:\n  ```yaml\n  apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1\n  kind: AuthorizationPolicy\n  metadata:\n    name: healthcheck-policy\n  spec:\n    selector:\n      matchLabels:\n        app: myapp\n    action: ALLOW\n    rules:\n    - to:\n      - operation:\n          paths: [\"/healthz\", \"/metrics\"]\n  ```",

Without interactive login capability, permitted unauthenticated actions are typically limited to read-only APIs for operational status.\n\n3. **Separation of Control and Data Planes**: Cloud-native architectures separate control planes (management interfaces) from data planes (application workloads). Apply strict authentication requirements to control planes while permitting necessary unauthenticated access at the data plane level where operationally required.\n\n4. **Dynamic Infrastructure**: The ephemeral nature of containers means permitted unauthenticated actions must be defined declaratively in configuration rather than on a per-instance basis. Focus on consistent policy enforcement through infrastructure-as-code.\n\n5. **Defense in Depth**: While certain actions may be permitted without authentication, use multiple security layers including network policies, namespace isolation, and read-only file systems to mitigate potential risks associated with these exceptions.\n\nWhen implementing AC-14 in cloud-native systems, the focus should be on minimizing permitted unauthenticated actions to only those absolutely necessary for operational requirements, documenting them thoroughly, and implementing compensating controls to reduce associated risks."

Authorize each type of remote access to the system prior to allowing such connections.\n\nNIST Discussion:\nRemote access is access to organizational systems (or processes acting on behalf of users) that communicate through external networks such as the Internet. Types of remote access include dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations use encrypted virtual private networks (VPNs) to enhance confidentiality and integrity for remote connections. The use of encrypted VPNs provides sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such connections as internal networks if the cryptographic mechanisms used are implemented in accordance with applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does not enhance the availability of remote connections. VPNs with encrypted tunnels can also affect the ability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. Remote access controls apply to systems other than public web servers or systems designed for public access. Authorization of each remote access type addresses authorization prior to allowing remote access without specifying the specific formats for such authorization. While organizations may use information exchange and system connection security agreements to manage remote access connections to other systems, such agreements are addressed as part of CA-3. Enforcing access restrictions for remote access is addressed via AC-3.",

Security Challenges in Cloud-Native Wireless Implementation**\n\n- Ephemeral container nature means wireless access controls must be applied dynamically\n- Service discovery in Kubernetes means wireless access authorization must adapt to changing endpoints\n- Zero-trust networking principles should be applied to all communication, with special attention to services accessible via wireless\n\n**4. Cloud Provider Nuances**\n\nDifferent cloud providers handle network controls differently:\n- AWS: Security groups and Network ACLs can be configured for wireless controls\n- Azure: Network Security Groups and Azure Firewall provide wireless access enforcement\n- GCP: VPC firewalls and service meshes provide layered control\n\n**5. Integration with Traditional Wireless Controls**\n\nCloud-native implementations should integrate with:\n- Wireless intrusion detection systems (SI-4(14))\n- VPN technologies for secure remote access\n- Organization-wide wireless access control policies\n- Certificate-based authentication systems for wireless networks\n\nThese implementation approaches follow zero-trust principles which are particularly important for wireless access in containerized environments where traditional network boundaries are blurred."

          "description": "a. Establish configuration requirements, connection requirements, and implementation guidance for organization-controlled mobile devices, to include when such devices are outside of controlled areas; and\n b. Authorize the connection of mobile devices to organizational systems.\n\nNIST Discussion:\nA mobile device is a computing device that has a small form factor such that it can easily be carried by a single individual; is designed to operate without a physical connection; possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and includes a self-contained power source. Mobile device functionality may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual. The processing, storage, and transmission capability of the mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of notebook/desktop systems, depending on the nature and intended purpose of the device. Protection and control of mobile devices is behavior or policy-based and requires users to take physical action to protect and control such devices when outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are spaces for which organizations provide physical or procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting information and systems.\n Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different characteristics and capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes or types of such devices. Usage restrictions and specific implementation guidance for mobile devices include configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective software, scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware.\n Usage restrictions and authorization to connect may vary among organizational systems. For example, the organization may authorize the connection of mobile devices to its network and impose a set of usage restrictions, while a system owner may withhold authorization for mobile device connection to specific applications or impose additional usage restrictions before allowing mobile device connections to a system. Adequate security for mobile devices goes beyond the requirements specified in AC-19. Many safeguards for mobile devices are reflected in other controls. AC-20 addresses mobile devices that are not organization-controlled.",

[Selection (one or more): Establish [Assignment: organization-defined terms and conditions]; Identify [Assignment: organization-defined controls asserted to be implemented on external systems]], consistent with the trust relationships established with other organizations owning, operating, and/or maintaining external systems, allowing authorized individuals to:\n 1. Access the system from external systems; and\n 2. Process, store, or transmit organization-controlled information using external systems; or\n b. Prohibit the use of [Assignment: organizationally-defined types of external systems].\n\nNIST Discussion:\nExternal systems are systems that are used by but not part of organizational systems, and for which the organization has no direct control over the implementation of required controls or the assessment of control effectiveness. External systems include personally owned systems, components, or devices; privately owned computing and communications devices in commercial or public facilities; systems owned or controlled by nonfederal organizations; systems managed by contractors; and federal information systems that are not owned by, operated by, or under the direct supervision or authority of the organization. External systems also include systems owned or operated by other components within the same organization and systems within the organization with different authorization boundaries. Organizations have the option to prohibit the use of any type of external system or prohibit the use of specified types of external systems, (e.g., prohibit the use of any external system that is not organizationally owned or prohibit the use of personally-owned systems).\n For some external systems (i.e., systems operated by other organizations), the trust relationships that have been established between those organizations and the originating organization may be such that no explicit terms and conditions are required. Systems within these organizations may not be considered external. These situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing information exchange agreements (either implicit or explicit) established between organizations or components or when such agreements are specified by applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, or standards. Authorized individuals include organizational personnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational systems and over which organizations have the authority to impose specific rules of behavior regarding system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized individuals need not be uniform, as the restrictions may vary depending on trust relationships between organizations. Therefore, organizations may choose to impose different security restrictions on contractors than on state, local, or tribal governments.\n External systems used to access public interfaces to organizational systems are outside the scope of AC-20. Organizations establish specific terms and conditions for the use of external systems in accordance with organizational security policies and procedures. At a minimum, terms and conditions address the specific types of applications that can be accessed on organizational systems from external systems and the highest security category of information that can be processed, stored, or transmitted on external systems. If the terms and conditions with the owners of the external systems cannot be established, organizations may impose restrictions on organizational personnel using those external systems.",

          "notes": "## 1. Unique Cloud-Native Security Considerations\n\n**Containerized Content Deployment:**\nContainer-based deployment introduces unique considerations for AC-22 implementation. Unlike traditional systems where content is often published directly to web servers, containerized deployments package content with application code. This requires special attention to:\n\n- Container image scanning not just for vulnerabilities but also for sensitive content\n- Version control and image tagging for all public-facing containers\n- Registry policy enforcement to prevent deployment of unapproved public content\n\n**Microservices Content Flow Considerations:**\nIn microservices architectures, content may flow through multiple services before reaching public interfaces. This introduces risks where:\n\n- Internal service data might inadvertently be exposed through API responses\n- Content transformation between services might remove security controls\n- Service-to-service communication could leak sensitive information\n\nImplementing a service mesh for all public-facing microservices provides additional protection by enforcing security policies at the service communication level.\n\n## 2. DevSecOps Integration for Public Content\n\nThe immutable nature of containers in cloud-native environments provides enhanced security for public content management. By treating public-facing containers as immutable artifacts, organizations can:\n\n- Create a verifiable chain of custody for all public content\n- Enable rapid rollback of problematic content\n- Maintain consistent audit trails through image tagging and signing\n\nUsing GitOps workflows with required approvals ensures that all content changes are thoroughly reviewed before deployment. This \"infrastructure as code\" approach to content management enhances both security and auditability.\n\n## 3. Cloud Provider Capabilities\n\nMajor cloud providers offer specialized services that can enhance AC-22 implementation:\n\n- Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) with built-in filtering capabilities\n- Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) to protect public-facing content\n- API Management services with content validation features\n- Managed Kubernetes services with enhanced security features\n\nOrganizations should leverage these provider-specific capabilities to enhance their AC-22 controls while maintaining a cloud-agnostic architectural approach that prevents vendor lock-in.\n\nBy implementing these cloud-native strategies for AC-22, organizations can effectively manage publicly accessible content in containerized, microservices-based environments while maintaining FedRAMP compliance and enhancing overall security posture."

The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of awareness and training policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to awareness and training policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.

Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of audit and accountability policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents.

Provide a rationale for why the event types selected for logging are deemed to be adequate to support after-the-fact investigations of incidents; and\n e. Review and update the event types selected for logging [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].\n\nNIST Discussion:\nAn event is an observable occurrence in a system. The types of events that require logging are those events that are significant and relevant to the security of systems and the privacy of individuals. Event logging also supports specific monitoring and auditing needs. Event types include password changes, failed logons or failed accesses related to systems, security or privacy attribute changes, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential usage, data action changes, query parameters, or external credential usage. In determining the set of event types that require logging, organizations consider the monitoring and auditing appropriate for each of the controls to be implemented. For completeness, event logging includes all protocols that are operational and supported by the system.\n To balance monitoring and auditing requirements with other system needs, event logging requires identifying the subset of event types that are logged at a given point in time. For example, organizations may determine that systems need the capability to log every file access successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance. The types of events that organizations desire to be logged may change. Reviewing and updating the set of logged events is necessary to help ensure that the events remain relevant and continue to support the needs of the organization. Organizations consider how the types of logging events can reveal information about individuals that may give rise to privacy risk and how best to mitigate such risks. For example, there is the potential to reveal personally identifiable information in the audit trail, especially if the logging event is based on patterns or time of usage.\n Event logging requirements, including the need to log specific event types, may be referenced in other controls and control enhancements. These include AC-2 (4), AC-3 (10), AC-6 (9), AC-17 (1), CM-3f, CM-5 (1), IA-3 (3) (b), MA-4 (1), MP-4 (2), PE-3, PM-21, PT-7, RA-8, SC-7 (9), SC-7 (15), SI-3 (8), SI-4 (22), SI-7 (8), and SI-10 (1). Organizations include event types that are required by applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. Audit records can be generated at various levels, including at the packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate level of event logging is an important part of a monitoring and auditing capability and can identify the root causes of problems. When defining event types, organizations consider the logging necessary to cover related event types, such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes and the actions that occur in service-oriented architectures.",

          "notes": "## Cloud-Native Specific Considerations\n\n1. **Ephemeral Nature of Containers**\n   - Containers' ephemeral nature presents unique challenges for audit logging, requiring immediate forwarding of logs to external storage\n   - As noted in the CNCF Cloud Native Security Whitepaper: \"Immediate forwarding of logs to a location inaccessible via cluster-level credentials also defeats an attacker's attempt to cover their tracks\"\n   - Short-lived containers may generate incomplete audit trails, requiring correlation with orchestration events\n\n2. **Scale and Volume Challenges**\n   - Cloud-native environments generate significantly more audit data due to the dynamic nature of containers\n   - The CNCF documentation notes that \"cloud native architectures are capable of generating more granular audit configuration and filtering than traditional legacy systems\"\n   - Implement log filtering at collection to prevent overwhelming the audit infrastructure\n\n3. **Distributed Responsibility Model**\n   - In cloud-native environments, audit responsibilities span across platform teams, security teams, and application teams\n   - Kubernetes audit logs capture platform-level events while application containers must implement their own audit mechanisms\n   - Establish clear ownership and responsibility for each audit layer to ensure comprehensive coverage\n\n4. **Kubernetes-Specific Audit Requirements**\n   - Configure API server auditing to capture authenticating, resource access, and administrative actions\n   - Ensure proper audit of admission controller decisions, particularly for security-related admission controllers\n   - Closely monitor privileged container creation, workload access to sensitive volumes, and network policy changes\n\n5. **Security Best Practices**\n   - Implement the principle of \"defense in depth\" by auditing at multiple layers\n   - As noted in NIST SP 800-190: \"All container creation should be associated with individual user identities and logged to provide a clear audit trail of activity\"\n   - Regularly test audit collection mechanisms to ensure they cannot be bypassed or disabled by attackers\n\nBy implementing these cloud-native specific approaches to AU-6, organizations can maintain effective audit record review, analysis, and reporting despite the dynamic and distributed nature of containerized environments."

Rather, integrated analysis requires that the analysis of information generated by scanning, monitoring, or other data collection activities is integrated with the analysis of audit record information. Security Information and Event Management tools can facilitate audit record aggregation or consolidation from multiple system components as well as audit record correlation and analysis. The use of standardized audit record analysis scripts developed by organizations (with localized script adjustments, as necessary) provides more cost-effective approaches for analyzing audit record information collected. The correlation of audit record information with vulnerability scanning information is important in determining the veracity of vulnerability scans of the system and in correlating attack detection events with scanning results. Correlation with performance data can uncover denial-of-service attacks or other types of attacks that result in the unauthorized use of resources. Correlation with system monitoring information can assist in uncovering attacks and in better relating audit information to operational situations.",

Containers running across multiple nodes and potentially multiple clusters require carefully coordinated time synchronization to maintain accurate audit trails.\n   - Microservices architecture increases the complexity of maintaining consistent timestamps, as services may span multiple containers, pods, and nodes.\n\n2. **Ephemeral Infrastructure Considerations**:\n   - Container instances are ephemeral, which means time synchronization must occur quickly at startup to ensure accurate timestamps for short-lived containers.\n   - Auto-scaling environments require robust time synchronization that can handle rapid scaling events without compromising timestamp accuracy.\n\n3. **Multi-Cloud and Hybrid Deployment Nuances**:\n   - Organizations using multiple cloud providers need to establish a consistent time source across providers to ensure accurate correlation of events.\n   - For hybrid deployments, synchronization between on-premises infrastructure and cloud resources requires special attention to maintain timestamp consistency.\n\n4. **Container Orchestration Impact**:\n   - Kubernetes provides mechanisms for setting time synchronization at the node level, but these must be properly configured.\n   - Pod initialization sequence should ensure time synchronization is established early in the container lifecycle.\n\n5. **Containerized Application Considerations**:\n   - Application code should use system time rather than maintaining internal time to ensure consistency with audit logs.\n   - Container applications should be designed to handle time zone differences correctly, preferably by standardizing on UTC.\n\n6. **Service Mesh Influence**:\n   - When implemented, service meshes can provide an additional layer of timestamp standardization through their proxies.\n   - Service mesh observability tools can help detect time-related anomalies across the microservices architecture.\n\n7. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**:\n   - Build and deployment pipelines should incorporate timestamp validation to ensure container images and deployments maintain consistent time references.\n   - Artifact signing mechanisms should include accurate timestamps for verification and audit purposes.\n\nBy following these implementation guidelines, organizations can effectively satisfy AU-8 Time Stamps requirements in cloud-native environments while leveraging the unique capabilities of container orchestration platforms and cloud services to enhance their audit and accountability posture."

The required skills include general knowledge of risk management concepts and approaches as well as comprehensive knowledge of and experience with the hardware, software, and firmware system components implemented.\n Organizations assess controls in systems and the environments in which those systems operate as part of initial and ongoing authorizations, continuous monitoring, FISMA annual assessments, system design and development, systems security engineering, privacy engineering, and the system development life cycle. Assessments help to ensure that organizations meet information security and privacy requirements, identify weaknesses and deficiencies in the system design and development process, provide essential information needed to make risk-based decisions as part of authorization processes, and comply with vulnerability mitigation procedures. Organizations conduct assessments on the implemented controls as documented in security and privacy plans. Assessments can also be conducted throughout the system development life cycle as part of systems engineering and systems security engineering processes. The design for controls can be assessed as RFPs are developed, responses assessed, and design reviews conducted. If a design to implement controls and subsequent implementation in accordance with the design are assessed during development, the final control testing can be a simple confirmation utilizing previously completed control assessment and aggregating the outcomes.\n Organizations may develop a single, consolidated security and privacy assessment plan for the system or maintain separate plans. A consolidated assessment plan clearly delineates the roles and responsibilities for control assessment. If multiple organizations participate in assessing a system, a coordinated approach can reduce redundancies and associated costs.\n Organizations can use other types of assessment activities, such as vulnerability scanning and system monitoring, to maintain the security and privacy posture of systems during the system life cycle. Assessment reports document assessment results in sufficient detail, as deemed necessary by organizations, to determine the accuracy and completeness of the reports and whether the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting requirements. Assessment results are provided to the individuals or roles appropriate for the types of assessments being conducted. For example, assessments conducted in support of authorization decisions are provided to authorizing officials, senior agency officials for privacy, senior agency information security officers, and authorizing official designated representatives.\n To satisfy annual assessment requirements, organizations can use assessment results from the following sources: initial or ongoing system authorizations, continuous monitoring, systems engineering processes, or system development life cycle activities. Organizations ensure that assessment results are current, relevant to the determination of control effectiveness, and obtained with the appropriate level of assessor independence. Existing control assessment results can be reused to the extent that the results are still valid and can also be supplemented with additional assessments as needed. After the initial authorizations, organizations assess controls during continuous monitoring. Organizations also establish the frequency for ongoing assessments in accordance with organizational continuous monitoring strategies.

          "description": "Employ independent assessors or assessment teams to conduct control assessments.\n\nNIST Discussion:\nIndependent assessors or assessment teams are individuals or groups who conduct impartial assessments of systems. Impartiality means that assessors are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of interest regarding the development, operation, sustainment, or management of the systems under assessment or the determination of control effectiveness. To achieve impartiality, assessors do not create a mutual or conflicting interest with the organizations where the assessments are being conducted, assess their own work, act as management or employees of the organizations they are serving, or place themselves in positions of advocacy for the organizations acquiring their services.\n Independent assessments can be obtained from elements within organizations or be contracted to public or private sector entities outside of organizations. Authorizing officials determine the required level of independence based on the security categories of systems and/or the risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals. Authorizing officials also determine if the level of assessor independence provides sufficient assurance that the results are sound and can be used to make credible, risk-based decisions. Assessor independence determination includes whether contracted assessment services have sufficient independence, such as when system owners are not directly involved in contracting processes or cannot influence the impartiality of the assessors conducting the assessments. During the system design and development phase, having independent assessors is analogous to having independent SMEs involved in design reviews.\n When organizations that own the systems are small or the structures of the organizations require that assessments be conducted by individuals that are in the developmental, operational, or management chain of the system owners, independence in assessment processes can be achieved by ensuring that assessment results are carefully reviewed and analyzed by independent teams of experts to validate the completeness, accuracy, integrity, and reliability of the results. Assessments performed for purposes other than to support authorization decisions are more likely to be useable for such decisions when performed by assessors with sufficient independence, thereby reducing the need to repeat assessments.",

System information exchanges include connections via leased lines or virtual private networks, connections to internet service providers, database sharing or exchanges of database transaction information, connections and exchanges with cloud services, exchanges via web-based services, or exchanges of files via file transfer protocols, network protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6), email, or other organization-to-organization communications. Organizations consider the risk related to new or increased threats that may be introduced when systems exchange information with other systems that may have different security and privacy requirements and controls. This includes systems within the same organization and systems that are external to the organization. A joint authorization of the systems exchanging information, as described in CA-6 (1) or CA-6 (2), may help to communicate and reduce risk.\n Authorizing officials determine the risk associated with system information exchange and the controls needed for appropriate risk mitigation. The types of agreements selected are based on factors such as the impact level of the information being exchanged, the relationship between the organizations exchanging information (e.g., government to government, government to business, business to business, government or business to service provider, government or business to individual), or the level of access to the organizational system by users of the other system. If systems that exchange information have the same authorizing official, organizations need not develop agreements. Instead, the interface characteristics between the systems (e.g., how the information is being exchanged. how the information is protected) are described in the respective security and privacy plans. If the systems that exchange information have different authorizing officials within the same organization, the organizations can develop agreements or provide the same information that would be provided in the appropriate agreement type from CA-3a in the respective security and privacy plans for the systems. Organizations may incorporate agreement information into formal contracts, especially for information exchanges established between federal agencies and nonfederal organizations (including service providers, contractors, system developers, and system integrators).

Ensure that the authorizing official for common controls authorizes the use of those controls for inheritance by organizational systems;\n e. Update the authorizations [Assignment: organization-defined frequency].\n\nNIST Discussion:\nAuthorizations are official management decisions by senior officials to authorize operation of systems, authorize the use of common controls for inheritance by organizational systems, and explicitly accept the risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation based on the implementation of agreed-upon controls. Authorizing officials provide budgetary oversight for organizational systems and common controls or assume responsibility for the mission and business functions supported by those systems or common controls. The authorization process is a federal responsibility, and therefore, authorizing officials must be federal employees. Authorizing officials are both responsible and accountable for security and privacy risks associated with the operation and use of organizational systems. Nonfederal organizations may have similar processes to authorize systems and senior officials that assume the authorization role and associated responsibilities.\n Authorizing officials issue ongoing authorizations of systems based on evidence produced from implemented continuous monitoring programs. Robust continuous monitoring programs reduce the need for separate reauthorization processes. Through the employment of comprehensive continuous monitoring processes, the information contained in authorization packages (i.e., security and privacy plans, assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones) is updated on an ongoing basis. This provides authorizing officials, common control providers, and system owners with an up-to-date status of the security and privacy posture of their systems, controls, and operating environments. To reduce the cost of reauthorization, authorizing officials can leverage the results of continuous monitoring processes to the maximum extent possible as the basis for rendering reauthorization decisions.",

The terms continuous and ongoing imply that organizations assess and monitor their controls and risks at a frequency sufficient to support risk-based decisions. Different types of controls may require different monitoring frequencies. The results of continuous monitoring generate risk response actions by organizations. When monitoring the effectiveness of multiple controls that have been grouped into capabilities, a root-cause analysis may be needed to determine the specific control that has failed. Continuous monitoring programs allow organizations to maintain the authorizations of systems and common controls in highly dynamic environments of operation with changing mission and business needs, threats, vulnerabilities, and technologies. Having access to security and privacy information on a continuing basis through reports and dashboards gives organizational officials the ability to make effective and timely risk management decisions, including ongoing authorization decisions.\n Automation supports more frequent updates to hardware, software, and firmware inventories, authorization packages, and other system information. Effectiveness is further enhanced when continuous monitoring outputs are formatted to provide information that is specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and timely. Continuous monitoring activities are scaled in accordance with the security categories of systems. Monitoring requirements, including the need for specific monitoring, may be referenced in other controls and control enhancements, such as AC-2g, AC-2 (7), AC-2 (12) (a), AC-2 (7) (b), AC-2 (7) (c), AC-17 (1), AT-4a, AU-13, AU-13 (1), AU-13 (2), CM-3f, CM-6d, CM-11c, IR-5, MA-2b, MA-3a, MA-4a, PE-3d, PE-6, PE-14b, PE-16, PE-20, PM-6, PM-23, PM-31, PS-7e, SA-9c, SR-4, SC-5 (3) (b), SC-7a, SC-7 (24) (b), SC-18b, SC-43b, and SI-4.",

Penetration testing goes beyond automated vulnerability scanning and is conducted by agents and teams with demonstrable skills and experience that include technical expertise in network, operating system, and/or application level security. Penetration testing can be used to validate vulnerabilities or determine the degree of penetration resistance of systems to adversaries within specified constraints. Such constraints include time, resources, and skills. Penetration testing attempts to duplicate the actions of adversaries and provides a more in-depth analysis of security- and privacy-related weaknesses or deficiencies. Penetration testing is especially important when organizations are transitioning from older technologies to newer technologies (e.g., transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 network protocols).\n Organizations can use the results of vulnerability analyses to support penetration testing activities. Penetration testing can be conducted internally or externally on the hardware, software, or firmware components of a system and can exercise both physical and technical controls. A standard method for penetration testing includes a pretest analysis based on full knowledge of the system, pretest identification of potential vulnerabilities based on the pretest analysis, and testing designed to determine the exploitability of vulnerabilities. All parties agree to the rules of engagement before commencing penetration testing scenarios. Organizations correlate the rules of engagement for the penetration tests with the tools, techniques, and procedures that are anticipated to be employed by adversaries. Penetration testing may result in the exposure of information that is protected by laws or regulations, to individuals conducting the testing. Rules of engagement, contracts, or other appropriate mechanisms can be used to communicate expectations for how to protect this information. Risk assessments guide the decisions on the level of independence required for the personnel conducting penetration testing.",

Dynamic Nature of Cloud-Native Connections\n\nThe ephemeral and dynamic nature of container-based architectures presents unique challenges for CA-9 implementation. Unlike traditional static systems, cloud-native environments experience constant changes:\n\n- Container instances are frequently created and destroyed as part of normal operations\n- Services scale up and down based on demand\n- Service discovery mechanisms dynamically track available endpoints\n- Network topologies change through automation\n\nThese characteristics require a more programmatic, policy-based approach to connection authorization, documentation, and monitoring rather than traditional static documentation.\n\n### 2. Zero Trust Architecture Alignment\n\nCloud-native implementations of CA-9 align well with Zero Trust principles, where:\n\n- All connections require authentication regardless of network location\n- Authorization decisions are made on a per-request basis\n- Communication between services is encrypted by default\n- Continuous monitoring and verification replace perimeter-based security\n\nA service mesh implementation provides the technical foundation for implementing these principles throughout the application's internal connections.\n\n### 3. Shared Responsibility Considerations\n\nIn cloud-native environments, responsibility for internal connections may be shared between:\n\n- The cloud service provider (CSP) for underlying infrastructure connections\n- Platform teams managing the Kubernetes cluster and platform services\n- Application teams defining service-to-service communication requirements\n\nA clear delineation of responsibilities is essential for comprehensive CA-9 implementation, with coordination between these teams to ensure no gaps in connection security.\n\n### 4. CI/CD Pipeline Integration\n\nThe documentation of internal connections in cloud-native systems should be integrated with CI/CD pipelines, where:\n\n- Connection specifications are defined as code alongside application code\n- Security requirements are automatically enforced through policy as code\n- Connection changes undergo automated security validation before deployment\n- Connection documentation is automatically generated and maintained as a pipeline artifact\n\nThis approach ensures that connection documentation remains accurate and current despite the rapid pace of cloud-native deployments."

Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission/business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents.

Monitor and control changes to the configuration settings in accordance with organizational policies and procedures.\n\nNIST Discussion:\nConfiguration settings are the parameters that can be changed in the hardware, software, or firmware components of the system that affect the security and privacy posture or functionality of the system. Information technology products for which configuration settings can be defined include mainframe computers, servers, workstations, operating systems, mobile devices, input/output devices, protocols, and applications. Parameters that impact the security posture of systems include registry settings; account, file, or directory permission settings; and settings for functions, protocols, ports, services, and remote connections. Privacy parameters are parameters impacting the privacy posture of systems, including the parameters required to satisfy other privacy controls. Privacy parameters include settings for access controls, data processing preferences, and processing and retention permissions. Organizations establish organization-wide configuration settings and subsequently derive specific configuration settings for systems. The established settings become part of the configuration baseline for the system.\n Common secure configurations (also known as security configuration checklists, lockdown and hardening guides, and security reference guides) provide recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration settings for information technology products and platforms as well as instructions for configuring those products or platforms to meet operational requirements. Common secure configurations can be developed by a variety of organizations, including information technology product developers, manufacturers, vendors, federal agencies, consortia, academia, industry, and other organizations in the public and private sectors.\n Implementation of a common secure configuration may be mandated at the organization level, mission and business process level, system level, or at a higher level, including by a regulatory agency. Common secure configurations include the United States Government Configuration Baseline USGCB and security technical implementation guides (STIGs), which affect the implementation of CM-6 and other controls such as AC-19 and CM-7. The Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) and the defined standards within the protocol provide an effective method to uniquely identify, track, and control configuration settings.",

CSPs and 3PAOs typically combine compliance check findings into a single CM-6 finding, which is acceptable. However, for initial assessments, annual assessments, and significant change requests, FedRAMP requires a clear understanding, on a per-control basis, where risks exist. Therefore, 3PAOs must also analyze compliance check findings as part of the controls assessment. Where a direct mapping exists, the 3PAO must document additional findings per control in the corresponding SAR Risk Exposure Table (RET), which are then documented in the CSP\u2019s Plan of Action and Milestones (POA&M). This will likely result in the details of individual control findings overlapping with those in the combined CM-6 finding, which is acceptable.\nDuring monthly continuous monitoring, new findings from CSP compliance checks may be combined into a single CM-6 POA&M item.

Microservices Architecture Implications\n\nCloud-native environments use microservices architecture, which introduces unique configuration challenges. Each service may have its own configuration needs, making centralized management complex. Implementation should focus on consistent configuration across services using:\n\n- Service mesh configurations for network policies and mutual TLS\n- Central policy engines for consistent enforcement\n- Configuration management systems that support distributed architectures\n\n### 2. Immutable Infrastructure Concept\n\nCloud-native systems often follow immutability principles where configurations are applied at build/deployment time rather than modified in place. This requires:\n\n- Strong configuration management during the build process\n- CI/CD pipelines that validate configurations before deployment\n- Version control and testing of configuration changes as code\n- Rebuilding and redeploying containers rather than modifying running instances\n\n### 3. Ephemeral Container Considerations\n\nContainers are ephemeral by nature, which creates unique configuration challenges:\n\n- Configurations must persist across container restarts\n- Runtime configuration changes should be minimized or eliminated\n- Configuration injection should happen at container startup\n- Environment-specific configurations should be separated from base images\n\n### 4. Cloud Provider Integration\n\nCloud-native implementations must consider the configuration settings available through cloud providers:\n\n- Understand configuration inheritance from cloud provider services\n- Document shared responsibilities for configuration management\n- Implement cloud-specific security configurations (IAM, network security)\n- Configure cloud provider logging and monitoring for configuration changes\n\n### 5. Container Orchestration Specifics\n\nKubernetes and other container orchestration platforms have unique configuration considerations:\n\n- Configure RBAC policies for cluster access\n- Implement namespace isolation with appropriate resource quotas\n- Apply Pod Security Standards appropriate to workload security needs\n- Configure network policies for east-west traffic control\n- Implement service mesh for advanced traffic management and security\n\nThe implementation of CM-6 in cloud-native environments requires a multi-layered approach that addresses the unique characteristics of containerized applications, Kubernetes orchestration, and cloud infrastructure while maintaining compliance with FedRAMP requirements."

Some of the functions and services routinely provided by default may not be necessary to support essential organizational missions, functions, or operations. Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from a single system component, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by that single component. Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a single function per component. Organizations consider removing unused or unnecessary software and disabling unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports and protocols to prevent unauthorized connection of components, transfer of information, and tunneling. Organizations employ network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protection technologies, such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems, to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, protocols, ports, and services. Least functionality can also be achieved as part of the fundamental design and development of the system (see SA-8, SC-2, and SC-3).",

Organizations may choose to implement centralized system component inventories that include components from all organizational systems. In such situations, organizations ensure that the inventories include system-specific information required for component accountability. The information necessary for effective accountability of system components includes the system name, software owners, software version numbers, hardware inventory specifications, software license information, and for networked components, the machine names and network addresses across all implemented protocols (e.g., IPv4, IPv6). Inventory specifications include date of receipt, cost, model, serial number, manufacturer, supplier information, component type, and physical location.\n Preventing duplicate accounting of system components addresses the lack of accountability that occurs when component ownership and system association is not known, especially in large or complex connected systems. Effective prevention of duplicate accounting of system components necessitates use of a unique identifier for each component. For software inventory, centrally managed software that is accessed via other systems is addressed as a component of the system on which it is installed and managed. Software installed on multiple organizational systems and managed at the system level is addressed for each individual system and may appear more than once in a centralized component inventory, necessitating a system association for each software instance in the centralized inventory to avoid duplicate accounting of components. Scanning systems implementing multiple network protocols (e.g., IPv4 and IPv6) can result in duplicate components being identified in different address spaces. The implementation of CM-8 (7) can help to eliminate duplicate accounting of components.",

          "description": "Develop, document, and implement a configuration management plan for the system that:\n a. Addresses roles, responsibilities, and configuration management processes and procedures;\n b. Establishes a process for identifying configuration items throughout the system development life cycle and for managing the configuration of the configuration items;\n c. Defines the configuration items for the system and places the configuration items under configuration management;\n d. Is reviewed and approved by [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles]; and\n e. Protects the configuration management plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.\n\nNIST Discussion:\nConfiguration management activities occur throughout the system development life cycle. As such, there are developmental configuration management activities (e.g., the control of code and software libraries) and operational configuration management activities (e.g., control of installed components and how the components are configured). Configuration management plans satisfy the requirements in configuration management policies while being tailored to individual systems. Configuration management plans define processes and procedures for how configuration management is used to support system development life cycle activities.\n Configuration management plans are generated during the development and acquisition stage of the system development life cycle. The plans describe how to advance changes through change management processes; update configuration settings and baselines; maintain component inventories; control development, test, and operational environments; and develop, release, and update key documents.\n Organizations can employ templates to help ensure the consistent and timely development and implementation of configuration management plans. Templates can represent a configuration management plan for the organization with subsets of the plan implemented on a system by system basis. Configuration management approval processes include the designation of key stakeholders responsible for reviewing and approving proposed changes to systems, and personnel who conduct security and privacy impact analyses prior to the implementation of changes to the systems. Configuration items are the system components, such as the hardware, software, firmware, and documentation to be configuration-managed. As systems continue through the system development life cycle, new configuration items may be identified, and some existing configuration items may no longer need to be under configuration control.",

This fundamentally changes how CM-11 is implemented, as \"software installation\" happens during image creation rather than at runtime on production systems.\n\n2. **Immutable Infrastructure Approach**\n   Cloud-native best practices emphasize immutable containers, where modifications are made to images rather than running containers. This means that software installation controls must focus on the image creation process, registry controls, and deployment validation rather than traditional runtime controls.\n\n3. **Declarative Configuration**\n   Container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes use declarative configuration, which allows for policy enforcement through admission controllers and other mechanisms that validate container configurations before deployment.\n\n4. **Multi-Tenant Considerations**\n   In cloud-native environments, multiple teams or applications often share the same infrastructure. This requires strong isolation between workloads and careful consideration of privilege levels to prevent unauthorized software installation across tenant boundaries.\n\n5. **Supply Chain Security**\n   For container environments, CM-11 implementation must consider the entire software supply chain, from base images to final deployment. The use of signed images, SBOMs, and image provenance attestations becomes critical for ensuring only authorized software is deployed.\n\n6. **Ephemeral Nature of Containers**\n   Due to the short-lived nature of many containers, traditional monitoring approaches may be insufficient. Container-specific monitoring solutions that focus on image verification prior to deployment are more effective than trying to detect unauthorized software in running containers."

Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents.

Contingency planning addresses system restoration and implementation of alternative mission or business processes when systems are compromised or breached. Contingency planning is considered throughout the system development life cycle and is a fundamental part of the system design. Systems can be designed for redundancy, to provide backup capabilities, and for resilience. Contingency plans reflect the degree of restoration required for organizational systems since not all systems need to fully recover to achieve the level of continuity of operations desired. System recovery objectives reflect applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidelines, organizational risk tolerance, and system impact level.\n Actions addressed in contingency plans include orderly system degradation, system shutdown, fallback to a manual mode, alternate information flows, and operating in modes reserved for when systems are under attack. By coordinating contingency planning with incident handling activities, organizations ensure that the necessary planning activities are in place and activated in the event of an incident. Organizations consider whether continuity of operations during an incident conflicts with the capability to automatically disable the system, as specified in IR-4 (5). Incident response planning is part of contingency planning for organizations and is addressed in the IR (Incident Response) family.",

          "notes": "## Cloud-Native Considerations for IA-1\n\n### 1. Identity Management Complexity\n\nIn cloud-native environments, identity management becomes more complex due to the increased number of components requiring authentication. A single transaction may involve multiple service-to-service authentications across containers running in different environments. Traditional perimeter-based identity approaches are insufficient - zero trust principles that verify every request regardless of source are essential.\n\n### 2. Ephemeral Infrastructure Challenges\n\nContainers and serverless functions are ephemeral by design, which creates unique challenges for traditional authentication models. Policies must address how short-lived components securely obtain and use credentials without creating security gaps during rapid scaling or rebuilding operations.\n\n### 3. Automation Requirements\n\nManual identity management procedures become impractical at cloud-native scale. Policies must embrace automated approaches to identity verification, certificate management, and policy enforcement to maintain security while enabling the agility that drives cloud-native adoption.\n\n### 4. Service Mesh Integration\n\nModern cloud-native architectures often leverage service meshes that provide identity and authentication capabilities. Policies should explicitly address how these service meshes integrate with organizational identity frameworks and how their capability is leveraged to meet FedRAMP requirements.\n\n### 5. Shifting Authentication Left\n\nCloud-native approaches require \"shifting authentication left\" in the development lifecycle. Identity and authentication concerns must be addressed during design and development phases rather than being added during deployment, as retrofitting authentication to complex microservices architectures is significantly more difficult.\n\n### 6. Defense-in-Depth Requirements\n\nCloud-native applications require multiple authentication layers - from infrastructure authentication to API and service authentication. Each layer requires specific policy guidance and implementation procedures to create a defense-in-depth approach that prevents cascade failures."

Organizational users include employees or individuals who organizations consider to have an equivalent status to employees (e.g., contractors and guest researchers). Unique identification and authentication of users applies to all accesses other than those that are explicitly identified in AC-14 and that occur through the authorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication. Since processes execute on behalf of groups and roles, organizations may require unique identification of individuals in group accounts or for detailed accountability of individual activity.\n Organizations employ passwords, physical authenticators, or biometrics to authenticate user identities or, in the case of multi-factor authentication, some combination thereof. Access to organizational systems is defined as either local access or network access. Local access is any access to organizational systems by users or processes acting on behalf of users, where access is obtained through direct connections without the use of networks. Network access is access to organizational systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where access is obtained through network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network access that involves communication through external networks. Internal networks include local area networks and wide area networks.\n The use of encrypted virtual private networks for network connections between organization-controlled endpoints and non-organization-controlled endpoints may be treated as internal networks with respect to protecting the confidentiality and integrity of information traversing the network.

Suspected security incidents include the receipt of suspicious email communications that can contain malicious code. Suspected supply chain incidents include the insertion of counterfeit hardware or malicious code into organizational systems or system components.

Incident response team personnel include forensic and malicious code analysts, tool developers, systems security and privacy engineers, and real-time operations personnel. The incident handling capability includes performing rapid forensic preservation of evidence and analysis of and response to intrusions. For some organizations, the incident response team can be a cross-organizational entity.\n An integrated incident response team facilitates information sharing and allows organizational personnel (e.g., developers, implementers, and operators) to leverage team knowledge of the threat and implement defensive measures that enable organizations to deter intrusions more effectively. Moreover, integrated teams promote the rapid detection of intrusions, the development of appropriate mitigations, and the deployment of effective defensive measures. For example, when an intrusion is detected, the integrated team can rapidly develop an appropriate response for operators to implement, correlate the new incident with information on past intrusions, and augment ongoing cyber intelligence development. Integrated incident response teams are better able to identify adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures that are linked to the operations tempo or specific mission and business functions and to define responsive actions in a way that does not disrupt those mission and business functions.

Incident response plans must account for this dynamic nature when identifying affected resources.\n\n3. **Immutable Infrastructure Principle**: The ideal response to a compromised container is not to patch it but to replace it with a clean version. This represents a fundamental shift from traditional incident response approaches.\n\n4. **Shared Responsibility Model**: Cloud-native architectures often operate on managed services, requiring clear documentation of which incident response activities are the responsibility of the cloud provider versus the organization.\n\n5. **Observability vs. Access**: Cloud-native security relies heavily on observability tools that can understand container constructs. Traditional incident response tools may not be suitable for these environments.\n\n6. **Supply Chain Focus**: Container security incidents often originate in the supply chain (base images, dependencies). Incident response plans must include procedures for tracing incidents to their origin in the supply chain.\n\n7. **Rapid Deployment Capabilities**: Cloud-native environments enable quick mitigation through rapid deployment of fixed versions, which should be incorporated into response timelines and procedures.\n\nThe cloud-native implementation of IR-8 requires significant adaptation of traditional incident response approaches to address the dynamic, ephemeral nature of containerized applications while leveraging the automation and observability advantages of cloud-native platforms."

This requires a fundamental shift in maintenance policy documentation to focus on image lifecycle management rather than system patching (NIST SP 800-190, Sections 4.2.2 and 4.5.3).\n\n### Shared Responsibility Clarification\nCloud-native environments operate with complex shared responsibility models between:\n- The cloud service provider (maintaining underlying infrastructure)\n- The organization (maintaining container orchestration platforms)\n- Development teams (maintaining application containers)\nThese boundaries must be explicitly documented in maintenance policies to avoid security gaps.\n\n### Scale and Automation Requirements\nThe scale of cloud-native deployments necessitates automation in maintenance activities. Manual maintenance procedures are insufficient for environments with potentially hundreds or thousands of containers. Policies must account for this scale by emphasizing automation, verification, and exception handling procedures (NIST SP 800-190, Section 4.5.3).\n\n### Forensics and Incident Response Integration\nMaintenance policies for cloud-native environments must include specific considerations for forensics and incident response. The ephemeral nature of containers requires specialized procedures for preserving evidence during incidents, including procedures for capturing container state before maintenance activities destroy potential evidence (NIST SP 800-190, Section 6.2).\n\n### Dependency Management Complexities\nCloud-native applications have complex dependency trees across containers, making maintenance more complicated than traditional systems. Policies must address how dependencies are tracked, vulnerability information is propagated across dependent services, and updates are coordinated to prevent service disruptions (NIST SP 800-190, Section 2.3.1-2.3.2)."

          "notes": "## Cloud-Native Specific Considerations\n\n1. **Immutable Infrastructure Approach**:\n   In cloud-native environments, the concept of \"maintenance\" differs from traditional systems. Instead of modifying running systems, the immutable infrastructure approach recommends replacing components entirely with updated versions. As stated in the CNCF Cloud Native Security Lexicon: \"Immutable means that a container, infrastructure, image, host, etc. won't be modified during its life: no updates, no patches, no configuration changes. If it must be updated (as is expected to sustain secure posture), then it must be rebuilt and redeployed.\"\n\n2. **Shared Responsibility Model**:\n   In cloud-native environments, maintenance responsibilities are shared between the cloud service provider and the organization. Clear documentation of these responsibilities is essential for FedRAMP compliance, especially when using managed Kubernetes services where the provider maintains the underlying infrastructure.\n\n3. **CI/CD Integration for Maintenance Records**:\n   Cloud-native environments leverage CI/CD pipelines not just for deployment but also as a comprehensive system of record for maintenance activities. Pipeline logs serve as authoritative maintenance records, documenting exactly what changes were made, when, by whom, and with what results - fulfilling MA-2's requirements for documentation.\n\n4. **Container-Specific Security Considerations**:\n   Container maintenance introduces unique security challenges compared to traditional systems. Container images may include numerous components from various sources, each with its own maintenance requirements. Organizations must track dependencies through SBOMs and implement container-specific security controls as outlined in NIST SP 800-190.\n\n5. **Ephemeral Resources**:\n   Many cloud-native resources are ephemeral by design, which changes the maintenance paradigm. Instead of maintaining long-lived systems, organizations must focus on maintaining the templates, pipelines, and configurations that generate these ephemeral resources, ensuring that newly created instances always incorporate the latest security updates and configurations.\n\nBy implementing these cloud-native approaches to maintenance, organizations can satisfy FedRAMP MA-2 requirements while leveraging the agility and security benefits of modern container technologies and DevSecOps practices."

Organizations have flexibility in determining roles for the approval of maintenance tools and how that approval is documented. A periodic review of maintenance tools facilitates the withdrawal of approval for outdated, unsupported, irrelevant, or no-longer-used tools. Maintenance tools can include hardware, software, and firmware items and may be pre-installed, brought in with maintenance personnel on media, cloud-based, or downloaded from a website. Such tools can be vehicles for transporting malicious code, either intentionally or unintentionally, into a facility and subsequently into systems. Maintenance tools can include hardware and software diagnostic test equipment and packet sniffers. The hardware and software components that support maintenance and are a part of the system (including the software implementing utilities such as ping, ls, ipconfig, or the hardware and software implementing the monitoring port of an Ethernet switch) are not addressed by maintenance tools.",

Organizations should update their control implementation to reflect these evolving roles.\n\n3. **Shared Responsibility Model**: Cloud-native implementations must clearly define the boundary between CSP (Cloud Service Provider) maintenance responsibilities and customer responsibilities:\n   - CSPs typically maintain underlying infrastructure\n   - Customers are responsible for container orchestration, applications, and data\n   - Clearly document which maintenance activities are performed by which party\n\n4. **CI/CD Pipeline Security**: As noted in NIST SP 800-204D, CI/CD pipelines require special security considerations for maintenance personnel:\n   - Pipelines may have privileged access to production environments\n   - Maintenance of the pipeline itself requires careful access control\n   - Apply the principle of least privilege to all pipeline-related maintenance activities\n\n5. **Immutable Infrastructure**: Cloud-native environments often follow immutable infrastructure principles, where systems are not modified in-place but replaced entirely. This changes how maintenance personnel perform their duties:\n   - Focus shifts from \"fixing\" to \"replacing\" components\n   - Maintenance activities concentrate on the CI/CD pipeline rather than runtime environments\n   - Personnel competency requirements may differ from traditional environments\n\n6. **Container Orchestration Complexity**: Kubernetes and other orchestration platforms introduce complexity that requires specialized knowledge:\n   - Ensure maintenance personnel have appropriate container orchestration expertise\n   - Implement guardrails and automated validation to prevent misconfigurations\n   - Consider implementing policy-as-code (e.g., OPA/Gatekeeper) to enforce maintenance standards\n\nBy implementing these cloud-native approaches to MA-5, organizations can effectively maintain control over maintenance personnel while leveraging the full benefits of containerized architectures and DevSecOps practices."

Microservices Architecture Considerations\n\n- **Design for resilience with circuit breakers** that prevent cascading failures when dependent services experience outages (NIST SP 800-204, \"Microservices-based Application Systems\").\n- **Implement asynchronous event-handling mechanisms** between components so that \"the impact of a component's outage is temporary since the required functions will automatically execute when the component begins running again\" (NIST SP 800-204).\n- **Adopt service mesh technologies** (like Istio or Linkerd) to provide traffic management, service discovery, and load balancing across microservices.\n- **Configure health checks and readiness probes** for all microservices to enable the orchestration platform to detect and replace failing components.\n- **Implement automated rollback capabilities** for all service deployments to quickly revert to known-good states after failed updates.\n\n### 3. DevSecOps Integration\n\n- **Establish CI/CD pipeline integration** with security scanning tools to maintain security posture during automated deployments.\n- **Implement \"rebuild and replace\" maintenance model** instead of patching in-place: \"While single vulnerabilities have long been able to cause problems across many systems, with containers, the response may require rebuilding and redeploying a new image widely, rather than installing a patch to existing systems\" (NIST SP 800-190, Operations and Maintenance Phase).\n- **Create automated testing procedures** to verify system functionality after maintenance activities.\n- **Develop maintenance automation scripts** that can be integrated into deployment pipelines to perform common system maintenance tasks.\n- **Document maintenance procedures** within infrastructure-as-code repositories to ensure consistency.\n\n### 4. Container Security Measures\n\n- **Implement container image scanning** as part of regular maintenance to detect and address vulnerabilities.\n- **Maintain a repository of validated, secure base images** that can be quickly deployed as replacements.\n- **Deploy sidecar containers** for specialized maintenance functions like log collection, monitoring, and security scanning.\n- **Establish immutable container policies** where containers are never updated in-place but are completely replaced with new instances.\n- **Implement container runtime security monitoring** to detect anomalous behavior that might indicate failures requiring maintenance.\n\n### 5.

The ephemeral nature of containerized applications means that individual components are designed to be replaced rather than repaired.\n\n2. **Microservices Resilience Benefits:**\n   Microservices architecture provides inherent advantages for meeting MA-6 requirements. As noted in NIST SP 800-204, \"The loose coupling between the components enables containment of the outage of a microservice such that the impact is restricted to that service without a domino effect on other components or other parts of the application.\"\n\n3. **Automated vs. Manual Recovery:**\n   Cloud-native environments should emphasize automated recovery over manual intervention. As noted in NIST SP 800-190, \"the ephemeral and automated nature of container management may not be aligned with the asset management policies and tools an organization has traditionally used.\" Organizations must adapt their maintenance procedures to this automated approach.\n\n4. **Shift from Patching to Replacement:**\n   Container-based environments typically employ a \"replace, not repair\" model for maintenance. Rather than patching existing containers, new containers with updated images are deployed. This approach requires rethinking traditional maintenance windows and procedures.\n\n5. **Balancing Automation with Human Oversight:**\n   While automation is essential for meeting MA-6 timelines in cloud-native environments, human oversight remains important. As noted in NIST SP 800-190, \"If a particular image is being exploited, but that image is in use across hundreds of containers, the response team may need to shut down all of these containers to stop the attack.\" Organizations should clearly define when automated maintenance is appropriate and when human intervention is required."

Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of media protection policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to media protection policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.

Secure storage includes a locked drawer, desk, or cabinet or a controlled media library. The type of media storage is commensurate with the security category or classification of the information on the media. Controlled areas are spaces that provide physical and procedural controls to meet the requirements established for protecting information and systems.

Examples include digital media in scanners, copiers, printers, notebook computers, workstations, network components, mobile devices, and non-digital media (e.g., paper and microfilm).

Sanitization techniques\u2014including clearing, purging, cryptographic erase, de-identification of personally identifiable information, and destruction\u2014prevent the disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals when such media is reused or released for disposal. Organizations determine the appropriate sanitization methods, recognizing that destruction is sometimes necessary when other methods cannot be applied to media requiring sanitization. Organizations use discretion on the employment of approved sanitization techniques and procedures for media that contains information deemed to be in the public domain or publicly releasable or information deemed to have no adverse impact on organizations or individuals if released for reuse or disposal.

In contrast to MP-2, which restricts user access to media, MP-7 restricts the use of certain types of media on systems, for example, restricting or prohibiting the use of flash drives or external hard disk drives. Organizations use technical and nontechnical controls to restrict the use of system media. Organizations may restrict the use of portable storage devices, for example, by using physical cages on workstations to prohibit access to certain external ports or disabling or removing the ability to insert, read, or write to such devices. Organizations may also limit the use of portable storage devices to only approved devices, including devices provided by the organization, devices provided by other approved organizations, and devices that are not personally owned. Finally, organizations may restrict the use of portable storage devices based on the type of device, such as by prohibiting the use of writeable, portable storage devices and implementing this restriction by disabling or removing the capability to write to such devices.

The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure.

Consider integrating these into your physical security policy for highly sensitive workloads.\n\n4. **Immutable Infrastructure Advantages**: Container-specific host OSes with immutable file systems provide significant security advantages by reducing the attack surface. This should be highlighted in policy documentation as a compensating control for traditional physical security measures.\n\n5. **Operational Consistency**: In cloud-native environments, ensuring consistency between physical security policy and actual implementation requires automation.

This requires shifting focus to the logical network protections while ensuring the CSP adequately handles physical protections.\n   - The traditional approach to physically securing wiring closets and cabling is replaced by logical controls like VPCs, network policies, and encryption.\n\n2. **Compensating Controls**\n   - Since direct physical access control to transmission lines is not possible, strong compensating controls must be implemented at the application and network layers.\n   - End-to-end encryption, particularly service mesh implementations, serves as a primary compensating control when physical access cannot be directly controlled.\n\n3. **Shared Responsibility Model Implications**\n   - Organizations must understand and document the division of responsibilities for PE-4 between themselves and their CSP.\n   - Responsibility for securing transmission paths is shared between the CSP (physical infrastructure) and the customer (virtual networks, container configurations, application-level encryption).\n\n4. **Kubernetes-Specific Considerations**\n   - Container orchestration platforms introduce unique network transmission paths that must be secured differently than traditional infrastructure.\n   - Network policies in Kubernetes control pod-to-pod communications but must be paired with additional controls for comprehensive protection.\n\n5. **Compliance Documentation Approach**\n   - Documentation must clearly articulate how the combination of CSP physical controls and customer-implemented logical controls together satisfy the intent of PE-4.\n   - The System Security Plan should reference the CSP's FedRAMP authorization for physical aspects of transmission protection.\n\nThese cloud-native adaptations maintain the security intention of PE-4 while recognizing the fundamental differences in how transmission lines are protected in modern containerized applications deployed in cloud environments."

Cloud Service Provider Responsibilities\n\nIn cloud-native environments, physical access monitoring is primarily the responsibility of the Cloud Service Provider (CSP) under the shared responsibility model:\n\n- **CSP Physical Security Documentation**: Request and review the CSP's documentation on physical security controls, including their implementation of PE-6. This should detail their physical access monitoring systems, surveillance equipment, and review procedures (CNCF Cloud Native Security Lexicon).\n\n- **Physical Access Monitoring Inheritance**: Document the inherited physical security monitoring controls in your System Security Plan (SSP), clearly indicating which aspects of PE-6 are handled by the CSP (including monitoring systems, access logs, and review procedures).\n\n- **Datacenter Access Controls**: CSPs typically implement comprehensive surveillance, intrusion detection, and access control systems for their datacenter facilities. Document the specific controls that the CSP has implemented to monitor physical access to facilities housing your system's infrastructure.\n\n- **Log Retention and Review**: Document the CSP's procedures for retaining and reviewing physical access logs, including automated monitoring, human review schedules, and incident response protocols for suspicious physical access events.\n\n### 2. Customer Responsibilities\n\nIn addition to leveraging CSP-inherited controls, cloud-native environments require complementary controls implemented by the customer:\n\n- **Administrative Console Access Monitoring**: Implement monitoring of administrative access to cloud management consoles, which serves as the logical equivalent of physical access in cloud environments. Configure alerting for unusual access patterns to cloud resources (NIST SP 800-204, Section 4.4).\n\n- **On-Premises Component Monitoring**: Implement physical access monitoring for any on-premises components that connect to cloud services (such as hybrid deployments with on-premises endpoints connecting to cloud services).\n\n- **Service Mesh Monitoring**: Implement security monitoring within the service mesh layer to detect unauthorized access to containerized applications. As noted in NIST SP 800-204 (MS-SS-5), \"Security monitoring should be performed at both the gateway and service level to detect, alert and respond to inappropriate behavior.\"\n\n- **Container Orchestration Security**: For Kubernetes environments, implement monitoring of privileged access to the orchestration control plane and worker nodes. Configure audit logging for all administrative actions to the orchestration platform (NIST SP 800-190).\n\n- **DevSecOps Integration**: Incorporate physical security monitoring into DevSecOps pipelines by:\n  - Implementing automated verification of security configurations during deployment\n  - Including security monitoring configurations in Infrastructure as Code (IaC)\n  - Automating the review of security monitoring logs and alerts\n\n### 3. Microservices-Specific Approaches\n\nFor microservices architecture in cloud-native environments:\n\n- **Service-to-Service Authentication**: Implement mutual TLS (mTLS) for all service-to-service communications to ensure only authenticated services can access each other (NIST SP 800-204).\n\n- **API Gateway Monitoring**: Configure the API gateway to monitor and log all access attempts, with anomaly detection capabilities to identify suspicious patterns that might indicate an attempt to bypass physical access controls through logical means.\n\n- **Distributed Monitoring**: Implement a central dashboard that \"displays the status of various services and the network segments that link them\" as recommended in NIST SP 800-204 (MS-SS-5). This should include security parameters and obvious signs of attack attempts.\n\n### 4. Container Security Measures\n\nFor container environments:\n\n- **Host-Level Monitoring**: Monitor access to container hosts and implement controls to prevent unauthorized container execution (NIST SP 800-190).\n\n- **Registry Security**: Secure container registries with strong authentication, as they are the logical equivalent of \"secure storage\" for container images. Monitor all access to these registries as part of your physical access monitoring strategy.\n\n- **Orchestrator Security**: Secure access to container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes) with strong authentication and authorization controls. Monitor physical access to nodes hosting critical orchestration components.",

          "notes": "## Cloud-Native Considerations for PE-6: Monitoring Physical Access\n\n### 1. Shared Responsibility Model Implications\n\nIn cloud-native environments, physical security monitoring follows a shared responsibility model where the CSP handles physical security for their infrastructure while customers are responsible for logical access security and on-premises components. This requires clear documentation of which entity is responsible for each aspect of PE-6.\n\n### 2. Logical Access as Physical Access Proxy\n\nIn cloud-native environments, logical access to management interfaces and APIs often replaces traditional physical access concerns. Organizations must adapt their physical access monitoring strategy to include enhanced logical access monitoring for cloud resources, treating privileged cloud console access similar to physical datacenter access.\n\n### 3. Microservices Security Boundaries\n\nMicroservices architectures create new security boundaries that differ from traditional monolithic applications. The distributed nature of microservices means physical access to a single component might compromise only part of a system. However, access to orchestration systems could potentially impact all containers and services. This creates a need for layered monitoring approaches that cover both physical and logical access at various levels of the stack.\n\n### 4. Container Immutability Benefits\n\nContainer immutability (described in the CNCF Cloud Native Security Lexicon) provides security benefits by ensuring that containers cannot be modified during their lifetime. This reduces the risk that physical access to infrastructure would allow persistent modifications to containers, as compromised containers would be replaced with clean images upon restart.\n\n### 5. Kubernetes-Specific Considerations\n\nFor Kubernetes environments, physical access monitoring should focus on the security of control plane components (API server, etcd, etc.) as these represent the highest-value targets. Physical access to worker nodes is still concerning but represents a more limited blast radius in well-architected systems with proper isolation between workloads.\n\n### 6. Multi-Cloud Complexity\n\nOrganizations using multiple cloud providers must reconcile different physical security monitoring implementations and documentation. This requires a consolidated approach to monitoring physical access across diverse environments, potentially using security information and event management (SIEM) solutions to aggregate and correlate physical access events from different providers.\n\n### 7. Regulatory Considerations\n\nFedRAMP implementations of PE-6 in cloud-native environments must still address the same basic control requirements, but the evidence and implementation will differ significantly from traditional on-premises systems. Assessors should be prepared to evaluate both the inherited CSP controls and the customer-implemented complementary controls as a unified control implementation."

A UPS is typically used to protect computers, data centers, telecommunication equipment, or other electrical equipment where an unexpected power disruption could cause injuries, fatalities, serious mission or business disruption, or loss of data or information. A UPS differs from an emergency power system or backup generator in that the UPS provides near-instantaneous protection from unanticipated power interruptions from the main power source by providing energy stored in batteries, supercapacitors, or flywheels. The battery duration of a UPS is relatively short but provides sufficient time to start a standby power source, such as a backup generator, or properly shut down the system.",

The primary responsibility for implementing physical emergency power systems rests with the CSP, not the customer organization. This represents a key difference from traditional on-premises implementations where the organization would be responsible for UPS systems and power redundancy.\n\n### 2. Risk Mitigation Strategies\n\nWhile physical power systems are managed by the CSP, cloud-native applications can implement additional resilience features to mitigate risks:\n\n- **Application-Level Resilience**: Designing applications to withstand infrastructure disruptions is critical in cloud-native architectures.\n  \n- **Multi-Region Strategies**: Distributing workloads across geographically dispersed regions can address power failures in a single data center.\n\n### 3. Containerization Impacts\n\nContainer-based deployments introduce unique considerations for PE-11:\n\n- **Fast Recovery**: Containerized applications typically restart more quickly after infrastructure disruptions compared to traditional VMs.\n  \n- **Orchestration Awareness**: Kubernetes and other orchestrators can detect node failures and automatically reschedule workloads to functioning nodes.\n\n### 4. FedRAMP Assessment Approach\n\nFor FedRAMP assessments, the approach to PE-11 differs substantially from traditional assessments:\n\n- **Documentation Review**: Assessment focuses on reviewing CSP certifications and the customer's resilience implementations.\n  \n- **Inherited Documentation**: Leveraging CSP-provided documentation about their emergency power implementation becomes key evidence.\n  \n- **Responsibility Boundaries**: Clear delineation of responsibilities between CSP and customer organizations must be documented in the SSP.\n\nBy implementing these cloud-native approaches to PE-11, organizations can meet FedRAMP requirements while leveraging the capabilities inherent in modern cloud infrastructure and containerized application architectures."

Container images and deployed containers replace physical hardware as the primary system components requiring delivery and removal controls.\n\n2. **Immutability Principle**:\n   Cloud-native containers follow the immutability principle, where containers are never modified in place. Instead, new containers are built, authorized, and deployed as replacements. This shifts the control focus to the image creation, authorization, and deployment pipeline.\n\n3. **Registry as Control Point**:\n   The container registry serves as the primary control point for implementing PE-16 requirements in cloud-native systems. Authorization to enter the environment is enforced at the registry level, making registry security critical.\n\n4. **Component Granularity**:\n   Container environments consist of many small, ephemeral components rather than fewer long-lived systems. PE-16 implementation must address the increased scale and distribution of components requiring tracking.\n\n5. **Automated Enforcement**:\n   Due to the scale and ephemeral nature of containers, automated enforcement mechanisms are essential for consistent application of PE-16 controls. Manual tracking processes will not scale in containerized environments.\n\n6. **Dynamic Infrastructure**:\n   Cloud-native environments are highly dynamic with frequent scaling events and automated deployments. PE-16 implementations must account for this dynamism with real-time authorization and tracking capabilities.\n\n7. **Integration with DevSecOps**:\n   PE-16 controls should be integrated into the DevSecOps pipeline, with authorization checks and record-keeping automated as part of the CI/CD process.

The focus shifts from securing specific physical locations to securing identity, access, and data regardless of location.\n\n2. **Shared Responsibility Model**: When implementing PE-17 for cloud-native systems, there is a clear division of responsibilities:\n   - Cloud Service Provider (CSP): Physical security of infrastructure, hypervisor security, network security\n   - Cloud Service Consumer: Identity management, access controls, application security, data protection\n\n3. **Immutable Infrastructure**: Cloud-native systems typically use immutable infrastructure patterns where systems are replaced rather than patched or modified. This approach enhances security at alternate work sites by ensuring all systems operate with known, consistent security configurations.\n\n4. **Container Isolation Limitations**: Containers provide process isolation but not full hardware virtualization (Secure Defaults, section 8). When accessing container orchestration from alternate work sites, additional security layers should be implemented to compensate for these limitations.\n\n5. **Ephemeral Resources**: The dynamic nature of containerized workloads means resources may be created and destroyed frequently. Security controls must account for the ephemeral nature of these resources and apply consistent security regardless of lifespan or access origin.\n\n6. **Defense in Depth**: Cloud-native PE-17 implementation should follow a defense-in-depth approach where security is implemented at multiple layers - network, identity, container, application, and data - to ensure robust protection regardless of access location.\n\n7. **Secure API Access**: Cloud-native systems are API-driven, making API security a critical component of PE-17 implementation. All API endpoints must be secured with appropriate authentication, authorization, and encryption to protect from unauthorized access from any location.\n\n8. **Continuous Verification**: The dynamic nature of cloud-native environments requires continuous verification of security controls rather than periodic assessment, especially when resources are accessed from multiple alternate work sites."

By leveraging cloud provider availability zones, Kubernetes scheduling features, and infrastructure as code practices, organizations can achieve the control objective of minimizing damage from physical threats while maintaining the operational benefits of cloud-native architecture."

The risk management strategy is an important factor in establishing such policies and procedures. Policies and procedures contribute to security and privacy assurance. Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on their development. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission level or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission/business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to planning policy and procedures include, but are not limited to, assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.

The plans describe the intended application of each selected control in the context of the system with a sufficient level of detail to correctly implement the control and to subsequently assess the effectiveness of the control. The control documentation describes how system-specific and hybrid controls are implemented and the plans and expectations regarding the functionality of the system. System security and privacy plans can also be used in the design and development of systems in support of life cycle-based security and privacy engineering processes. System security and privacy plans are living documents that are updated and adapted throughout the system development life cycle (e.g., during capability determination, analysis of alternatives, requests for proposal, and design reviews). Section 2.1 describes the different types of requirements that are relevant to organizations during the system development life cycle and the relationship between requirements and controls.\n Organizations may develop a single, integrated security and privacy plan or maintain separate plans. Security and privacy plans relate security and privacy requirements to a set of controls and control enhancements. The plans describe how the controls and control enhancements meet the security and privacy requirements but do not provide detailed, technical descriptions of the design or implementation of the controls and control enhancements. Security and privacy plans contain sufficient information (including specifications of control parameter values for selection and assignment operations explicitly or by reference) to enable a design and implementation that is unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and subsequent determinations of risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation if the plan is implemented.\n Security and privacy plans need not be single documents. The plans can be a collection of various documents, including documents that already exist. Effective security and privacy plans make extensive use of references to policies, procedures, and additional documents, including design and implementation specifications where more detailed information can be obtained. The use of references helps reduce the documentation associated with security and privacy programs and maintains the security- and privacy-related information in other established management and operational areas, including enterprise architecture, system development life cycle, systems engineering, and acquisition. Security and privacy plans need not contain detailed contingency plan or incident response plan information but can instead provide\u2014explicitly or by reference\u2014sufficient information to define what needs to be accomplished by those plans.\n Security- and privacy-related activities that may require coordination and planning with other individuals or groups within the organization include assessments, audits, inspections, hardware and software maintenance, acquisition and supply chain risk management, patch management, and contingency plan testing. Planning and coordination include emergency and nonemergency (i.e., planned or non-urgent unplanned) situations. The process defined by organizations to plan and coordinate security- and privacy-related activities can also be included in other documents, as appropriate.",

Other types of access agreements include nondisclosure agreements, conflict-of-interest agreements, and acceptable use agreements (see PS-6). Organizations consider rules of behavior based on individual user roles and responsibilities and differentiate between rules that apply to privileged users and rules that apply to general users. Establishing rules of behavior for some types of non-organizational users, including individuals who receive information from federal systems, is often not feasible given the large number of such users and the limited nature of their interactions with the systems. Rules of behavior for organizational and non-organizational users can also be established in AC-8. The related controls section provides a list of controls that are relevant to organizational rules of behavior.

Describe the requirements and approach to be taken for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational information;\n 2. Describe the requirements and approach to be taken for processing personally identifiable information to minimize privacy risk to individuals;\n 3. Describe how the architectures are integrated into and support the enterprise architecture; and\n 4. Describe any assumptions about, and dependencies on, external systems and services;\n b. Review and update the architectures [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] to reflect changes in the enterprise architecture; and\n c. Reflect planned architecture changes in security and privacy plans, Concept of Operations (CONOPS), criticality analysis, organizational procedures, and procurements and acquisitions.\n\nNIST Discussion:\nThe security and privacy architectures at the system level are consistent with the organization-wide security and privacy architectures described in PM-7, which are integral to and developed as part of the enterprise architecture. The architectures include an architectural description, the allocation of security and privacy functionality (including controls), security- and privacy-related information for external interfaces, information being exchanged across the interfaces, and the protection mechanisms associated with each interface. The architectures can also include other information, such as user roles and the access privileges assigned to each role; security and privacy requirements; types of information processed, stored, and transmitted by the system; supply chain risk management requirements; restoration priorities of information and system services; and other protection needs.\n SP 800-160-1 provides guidance on the use of security architectures as part of the system development life cycle process. OMB M-19-03 requires the use of the systems security engineering concepts described in SP 800-160-1 for high value assets. Security and privacy architectures are reviewed and updated throughout the system development life cycle, from analysis of alternatives through review of the proposed architecture in the RFP responses to the design reviews before and during implementation (e.g., during preliminary design reviews and critical design reviews).\n In today\u2019s modern computing architectures, it is becoming less common for organizations to control all information resources. There may be key dependencies on external information services and service providers. Describing such dependencies in the security and privacy architectures is necessary for developing a comprehensive mission and business protection strategy. Establishing, developing, documenting, and maintaining under configuration control a baseline configuration for organizational systems is critical to implementing and maintaining effective architectures. The development of the architectures is coordinated with the senior agency information security officer and the senior agency official for privacy to ensure that the controls needed to support security and privacy requirements are identified and effectively implemented. In many circumstances, there may be no distinction between the security and privacy architecture for a system. In other circumstances, security objectives may be adequately satisfied, but privacy objectives may only be partially satisfied by the security requirements. In these cases, consideration of the privacy requirements needed to achieve satisfaction will result in a distinct privacy architecture. The documentation, however, may simply reflect the combined architectures.\n PL-8 is primarily directed at organizations to ensure that architectures are developed for the system and, moreover, that the architectures are integrated with or tightly coupled to the enterprise architecture. In contrast, SA-17 is primarily directed at the external information technology product and system developers and integrators. SA-17, which is complementary to PL-8, is selected when organizations outsource the development of systems or components to external entities and when there is a need to demonstrate consistency with the organization\u2019s enterprise architecture and security and privacy architectures.",

Stakeholder needs consider mission and business requirements as well as mandates imposed by applicable laws, executive orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidelines. For example, the control baselines in SP 800-53B are based on the requirements from FISMA and PRIVACT. The requirements, along with the NIST standards and guidelines implementing the legislation, direct organizations to select one of the control baselines after the reviewing the information types and the information that is processed, stored, and transmitted on the system; analyzing the potential adverse impact of the loss or compromise of the information or system on the organization\u2019s operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the Nation; and considering the results from system and organizational risk assessments.

Tailoring a control baseline is accomplished by identifying and designating common controls, applying scoping considerations, selecting compensating controls, assigning values to control parameters, supplementing the control baseline with additional controls as needed, and providing information for control implementation. The general tailoring actions in SP 800-53B can be supplemented with additional actions based on the needs of organizations. Tailoring actions can be applied to the baselines in SP 800-53B in accordance with the security and privacy requirements from FISMA, PRIVACT, and OMB A-130.

Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission/business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure.

Proper position designation is the foundation of an effective and consistent suitability and personnel security program. The Position Designation System (PDS) assesses the duties and responsibilities of a position to determine the degree of potential damage to the efficiency or integrity of the service due to misconduct of an incumbent of a position and establishes the risk level of that position. The PDS assessment also determines if the duties and responsibilities of the position present the potential for position incumbents to bring about a material adverse effect on national security and the degree of that potential effect, which establishes the sensitivity level of a position. The results of the assessment determine what level of investigation is conducted for a position. Risk designations can guide and inform the types of authorizations that individuals receive when accessing organizational information and information systems. Position screening criteria include explicit information security role appointment requirements. Parts 1400 and 731 of Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, establish the requirements for organizations to evaluate relevant covered positions for a position sensitivity and position risk designation commensurate with the duties and responsibilities of those positions.",

Position risk designations must account for this reality by implementing dynamic risk evaluation that focuses on actual platform access rather than just traditional job titles.\n\n2. **Infrastructure as Code Impact**: When infrastructure is managed as code through repositories, position risk designations must extend to source code repository access. Personnel with rights to approve changes to infrastructure code repositories should be designated at appropriate risk levels even if they don't directly interact with the production environment.\n\n3. **Automation Considerations**: Cloud-native environments rely heavily on automation. Position risk designations should account for indirect access through automation tools and pipelines. Personnel who control CI/CD pipelines may have elevated risk levels despite not having direct platform access.\n\n4. **Rapid Evolution**: Cloud-native technologies evolve rapidly, requiring more frequent reviews of position risk designations than traditional environments. Organizations should implement automated triggers for position risk reviews when adding new platform capabilities or changing access control paradigms.\n\n5. **Shared Responsibility Model**: Cloud-native environments operate under a shared responsibility model between the organization and cloud provider. Position risk designations should clearly delineate responsibilities and account for the provider's personnel who may have access to the underlying infrastructure."

          "notes": "## Cloud-Native Operational Considerations\n\n- **Ephemeral Infrastructure Challenges**: Cloud-native environments often use ephemeral resources that require different access control approaches compared to traditional systems. When personnel transfer, focus on controlling access to configuration systems rather than individual resources, as the resources themselves may be short-lived.\n\n- **Infrastructure as Code Impact**: Personnel transfers in cloud-native environments must consider access to IaC repositories, which effectively control all infrastructure. Specific controls should address IaC repository access during transfers, as these repositories represent the definitive state of the infrastructure.\n\n- **Service Identity vs. Human Identity**: Cloud-native systems heavily rely on service identities (service accounts) that may be managed by specific personnel. Transfer procedures must address both human identity access and service identity management responsibilities, clearly delineating ownership of both types of identities.\n\n## Security Implementation Notes\n\n- **GitOps Security Implications**: In GitOps workflows, repository access effectively grants infrastructure modification capabilities. Personnel transfers must include specific GitOps repository access controls to ensure that changes to infrastructure follow proper authorization processes.\n\n- **CI/CD Pipeline Privileged Access**: CI/CD pipelines often require privileged access to deploy to production environments. Personnel transfers should include explicit handling of pipeline access credentials to prevent unauthorized access to production systems during role transitions.\n\n- **Multi-Environment Permissions**: Cloud-native applications typically span multiple environments (dev, test, staging, production). Transfer procedures must address appropriate access levels across all environments based on new roles, ensuring consistent access patterns across the deployment pipeline.\n\n## Architectural Considerations\n\n- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Implementation of PS-5 in cloud-native environments aligns with zero trust principles by requiring continuous verification of access needs regardless of previous authorizations. This is especially important during personnel transfers when access requirements may change.\n\n- **Control Plane vs. Data Plane Access**: Kubernetes and service mesh architectures separate control plane and data plane operations. Personnel transfers must address both types of access separately, as they represent different security domains with different risk profiles.\n\n- **Mesh Federation Implications**: In multi-cluster or multi-mesh environments, personnel transfers must consider cross-cluster and cross-mesh access controls that may span multiple administrative domains. This becomes increasingly important in large-scale distributed systems where access control is federation-based.\n\nBy implementing these cloud-native approaches to PS-5, organizations can effectively manage personnel transfers while maintaining appropriate access controls in containerized, Kubernetes-orchestrated environments and supporting DevSecOps processes."

Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to risk assessment policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines. Simply restating controls does not constitute an organizational policy or procedure.",

          "notes": "### 1. Unique Cloud-Native Considerations\n\n- **Ephemeral nature of containers** requires different risk assessment approaches than traditional systems. Unlike conventional servers that remain online for months or years, containers may have lifecycles measured in hours or minutes, requiring automated, continuous risk assessment rather than point-in-time evaluations.\n\n- **Shared kernel architecture** in container technologies introduces unique risks not present in traditional or VM-based deployments. Per NIST SP 800-190, containers share the host OS kernel, introducing the risk that a container escape vulnerability could affect all containers on the same host.\n\n- **Image-based deployment model** fundamentally changes vulnerability management approach. Risk assessment must consider both the container image supply chain and runtime environment, rather than focusing only on running systems.\n\n- **Container orchestration systems** like Kubernetes add complexity to the risk assessment process, requiring evaluation of cluster-level access controls, network policies, and resource allocation that don't exist in traditional environments.\n\n### 2. Implementation Considerations\n\n- **Automation is essential**, not optional, for risk assessment in cloud-native environments due to the scale and rate of change. Manual processes cannot keep pace with container deployment frequency.\n\n- **Container-specific operating systems** (like Container-Optimized OS, Fedora CoreOS) provide smaller attack surfaces and should be preferred over general-purpose operating systems according to NIST SP 800-190 guidance.\n\n- **Workload separation by sensitivity** should be implemented by grouping containers with the same purpose, sensitivity, and threat posture on a single host kernel to provide defense in depth.\n\n- **Hardware-based trust** provides a foundation for secure cloud-native environments, extending from TPM through the OS kernel to container runtimes and images.\n\n- **Dynamic network environments** in microservices architectures require specialized approaches to risk assessment that account for service-to-service communications and API security.\n\n### 3. Technology-Specific Guidance\n\n- **Kubernetes security posture** should be continuously assessed using specialized tools rather than traditional vulnerability scanners, which may not understand Kubernetes-specific configurations and risks.\n\n- **Service mesh implementations** (like Istio, Linkerd) provide additional security controls for microservices that should be incorporated into risk assessment processes.\n\n- **CI/CD pipeline security** is critical as it represents the primary deployment path for containers. Risk assessment must evaluate pipeline integrity and security controls.\n\n- **Container runtime selection** impacts the overall security posture and should be evaluated as part of the risk assessment process. Different runtimes offer varying security features and isolation capabilities.\n\n- **API security** becomes paramount in microservices environments and requires specific attention in risk assessment processes, particularly for externally exposed endpoints."

Security categorization is also a type of asset loss characterization in systems security engineering processes that is carried out throughout the system development life cycle.

Organizations consider the potential adverse impacts to other organizations and, in accordance with USA PATRIOT and Homeland Security Presidential Directives, potential national-level adverse impacts.\n Security categorization processes facilitate the development of inventories of information assets and, along with CM-8, mappings to specific system components where information is processed, stored, or transmitted.

Employ vulnerability monitoring tools that include the capability to readily update the vulnerabilities to be scanned.\n\nNIST Discussion:\nSecurity categorization of information and systems guides the frequency and comprehensiveness of vulnerability monitoring (including scans). Organizations determine the required vulnerability monitoring for system components, ensuring that the potential sources of vulnerabilities\u2014such as infrastructure components (e.g., switches, routers, guards, sensors), networked printers, scanners, and copiers\u2014are not overlooked. The capability to readily update vulnerability monitoring tools as new vulnerabilities are discovered and announced and as new scanning methods are developed helps to ensure that new vulnerabilities are not missed by employed vulnerability monitoring tools. The vulnerability monitoring tool update process helps to ensure that potential vulnerabilities in the system are identified and addressed as quickly as possible. Vulnerability monitoring and analyses for custom software may require additional approaches, such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can use these analysis approaches in source code reviews and in a variety of tools, including web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, and binary analyzers. \n Vulnerability monitoring includes scanning for patch levels; scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and scanning for flow control mechanisms that are improperly configured or operating incorrectly. Vulnerability monitoring may also include continuous vulnerability monitoring tools that use instrumentation to continuously analyze components. Instrumentation-based tools may improve accuracy and may be run throughout an organization without scanning. Vulnerability monitoring tools that facilitate interoperability include tools that are Security Content Automated Protocol (SCAP)-validated. Thus, organizations consider using scanning tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that employ the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine the presence of vulnerabilities. Sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). Control assessments, such as red team exercises, provide additional sources of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan. Organizations also consider using scanning tools that express vulnerability impact by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).\n Vulnerability monitoring includes a channel and process for receiving reports of security vulnerabilities from the public at-large. Vulnerability disclosure programs can be as simple as publishing a monitored email address or web form that can receive reports, including notification authorizing good-faith research and disclosure of security vulnerabilities. Organizations generally expect that such research is happening with or without their authorization and can use public vulnerability disclosure channels to increase the likelihood that discovered vulnerabilities are reported directly to the organization for remediation.\n Organizations may also employ the use of financial incentives (also known as bug bounties) to further encourage external security researchers to report discovered vulnerabilities. Bug bounty programs can be tailored to the organization\u2019s needs. Bounties can be operated indefinitely or over a defined period of time and can be offered to the general public or to a curated group. Organizations may run public and private bounties simultaneously and could choose to offer partially credentialed access to certain participants in order to evaluate security vulnerabilities from privileged vantage points.",

Rather than patching running containers, the standard approach is to rebuild container images with security fixes and redeploy them (CNCF Cloud Native Security Lexicon)\n- **Container Security Challenges**: Key risks include registry/repository poisoning, unmonitored container-to-container communication, and ephemeral instances that aren't tracked (FedRAMP Vulnerability Scanning Requirements for Containers)\n- **Shared Kernel Architecture**: Containers on the same host share the kernel, creating unique security considerations compared to traditional VM architectures. Containers with different sensitivity levels should not share host kernels (NIST SP 800-190)\n\n## 2. Vulnerability Scanning Distinctions\n\n- **Scanning Frequency vs. Container Lifecycle**: Container images must be scanned at least monthly, but their ephemeral nature means containers may be replaced frequently. The 30-day scanning window begins as soon as a container is deployed to the production registry (FedRAMP Vulnerability Scanning Requirements for Containers)\n- **Container vs. Host Scanning**: While traditional vulnerability scanning focuses on persistent systems, container scanning requires both static image scanning and runtime behavior analysis (CNCF Cloud Native Security Whitepaper)\n- **CI/CD Integration Importance**: Vulnerability scanning must be integrated into CI/CD pipelines for effectiveness, as post-deployment scanning of containers goes against the immutable infrastructure principle (FedRAMP Cloud Native Crosswalk)\n\n## 3. Implementation Challenges\n\n- **Container Image Complexity**: Modern container images often contain numerous dependencies, making comprehensive vulnerability scanning challenging but essential (CNCF Cloud Native Security Lexicon)\n- **Vulnerability Context in Microservices**: Not all vulnerabilities in container images may be exploitable in the context of the application, requiring additional context for proper risk assessment (FedRAMP Cloud Native Crosswalk)\n- **Scan Performance Concerns**: Comprehensive container scanning can impact build and deployment pipelines; organizations need to balance security with performance (NIST SP 800-190)\n\n## 4. Future Considerations\n\n- **AI/ML for Behavioral Analysis**: Future scanning approaches will increasingly leverage AI and machine learning for behavioral and heuristic environment analysis to detect unwanted activities (FedRAMP Cloud Native Crosswalk)\n- **Supply Chain Security Integration**: Vulnerability scanning is becoming more integrated with software supply chain security, with increased focus on provenance and attestation (FedRAMP Cloud Native Crosswalk)\n- **Zero Trust Architecture Alignment**: Container vulnerability scanning strategies should align with zero trust architecture principles, focusing on continuous validation rather than periodic scanning (NIST SP 800-207)\n\nBy implementing these cloud-native guidance points for RA-5, organizations can effectively monitor and scan for vulnerabilities in containerized and microservices-based environments, addressing the unique security challenges of these modern architectures while meeting FedRAMP requirements."

The functional decomposition includes the identification of organizational missions supported by the system, decomposition into the specific functions to perform those missions, and traceability to the hardware, software, and firmware components that implement those functions, including when the functions are shared by many components within and external to the system. \n The operational environment of a system or a system component may impact the criticality, including the connections to and dependencies on cyber-physical systems, devices, system-of-systems, and outsourced IT services. System components that allow unmediated access to critical system components or functions are considered critical due to the inherent vulnerabilities that such components create. Component and function criticality are assessed in terms of the impact of a component or function failure on the organizational missions that are supported by the system that contains the components and functions.\n Criticality analysis is performed when an architecture or design is being developed, modified, or upgraded. If such analysis is performed early in the system development life cycle, organizations may be able to modify the system design to reduce the critical nature of these components and functions, such as by adding redundancy or alternate paths into the system design. Criticality analysis can also influence the protection measures required by development contractors. In addition to criticality analysis for systems, system components, and system services, criticality analysis of information is an important consideration. Such analysis is conducted as part of security categorization in RA-2.",

Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of system and services acquisition policy and procedures.

The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure.

The integration of security and privacy considerations early in the system development life cycle is a foundational principle of systems security engineering and privacy engineering. To apply the required controls within the system development life cycle requires a basic understanding of information security and privacy, threats, vulnerabilities, adverse impacts, and risk to critical mission and business functions. The security engineering principles in SA-8 help individuals properly design, code, and test systems and system components. Organizations include qualified personnel (e.g., senior agency information security officers, senior agency officials for privacy, security and privacy architects, and security and privacy engineers) in system development life cycle processes to ensure that established security and privacy requirements are incorporated into organizational systems. Role-based security and privacy training programs can ensure that individuals with key security and privacy roles and responsibilities have the experience, skills, and expertise to conduct assigned system development life cycle activities. \n The effective integration of security and privacy requirements into enterprise architecture also helps to ensure that important security and privacy considerations are addressed throughout the system life cycle and that those considerations are directly related to organizational mission and business processes. This process also facilitates the integration of the information security and privacy architectures into the enterprise architecture, consistent with the risk management strategy of the organization. Because the system development life cycle involves multiple organizations, (e.g., external suppliers, developers, integrators, service providers), acquisition and supply chain risk management functions and controls play significant roles in the effective management of the system during the life cycle.",

The derived requirements include security and privacy capabilities, functions, and mechanisms. Strength requirements associated with such capabilities, functions, and mechanisms include degree of correctness, completeness, resistance to tampering or bypass, and resistance to direct attack. Assurance requirements include development processes, procedures, and methodologies as well as the evidence from development and assessment activities that provide grounds for confidence that the required functionality is implemented and possesses the required strength of mechanism. SP 800-160-1 describes the process of requirements engineering as part of the system development life cycle.\n Controls can be viewed as descriptions of the safeguards and protection capabilities appropriate for achieving the particular security and privacy objectives of the organization and for reflecting the security and privacy requirements of stakeholders. Controls are selected and implemented in order to satisfy system requirements and include developer and organizational responsibilities. Controls can include technical, administrative, and physical aspects. In some cases, the selection and implementation of a control may necessitate additional specification by the organization in the form of derived requirements or instantiated control parameter values. The derived requirements and control parameter values may be necessary to provide the appropriate level of implementation detail for controls within the system development life cycle.\n Security and privacy documentation requirements address all stages of the system development life cycle. Documentation provides user and administrator guidance for the implementation and operation of controls. The level of detail required in such documentation is based on the security categorization or classification level of the system and the degree to which organizations depend on the capabilities, functions, or mechanisms to meet risk response expectations. Requirements can include mandated configuration settings that specify allowed functions, ports, protocols, and services. Acceptance criteria for systems, system components, and system services are defined in the same manner as the criteria for any organizational acquisition or procurement.",

          "notes": "### 1. Cloud-Native Documentation Challenges\n\n- **Ephemeral Infrastructure**: Unlike traditional systems, containers are ephemeral by design, making point-in-time documentation less valuable. Documentation should focus on the declarative configurations that generate the environment rather than specific instances.\n\n- **Immutable Infrastructure**: Container environments follow immutable infrastructure principles where infrastructure is never modified in place but replaced entirely. Documentation should reflect this philosophy by focusing on build processes rather than maintenance procedures.\n\n- **Rapid Change Cycles**: Containerized applications typically have much faster update cycles than traditional applications. Documentation processes must account for this by using automation to generate up-to-date documentation.\n\n### 2. Cloud-Native Documentation Approaches\n\n- **Documentation as Code**: Treat documentation as code by:\n  - Storing documentation in version control alongside application code\n  - Implementing automated documentation testing and validation\n  - Using code review processes for documentation changes\n  - Implementing continuous integration for documentation updates\n\n- **Living Documentation**: Implement \"living documentation\" approaches:\n  - Generate documentation directly from deployment configurations\n  - Use GitOps workflows to ensure documentation and actual deployments are aligned\n  - Generate real-time documentation from runtime environments\n\n- **Service Ownership Model**: Adopt service ownership model where:\n  - Each microservice team maintains its own documentation\n  - Clear interfaces and contracts between services are documented\n  - Cross-cutting concerns are documented centrally\n\n### 3. Provider-Specific Considerations\n\n- **Managed Kubernetes Services**: When using managed Kubernetes services (EKS, GKE, AKS):\n  - Document the division of responsibilities between CSP and organization\n  - Maintain documentation of CSP-specific configurations and integrations\n  - Document how provider updates and changes are managed\n\n- **Container Security Services**: When using cloud provider container security services:\n  - Document integration points with native container security tools\n  - Maintain procedures for reviewing and acting on provider-generated security findings\n  - Document complementary controls needed beyond provider offerings\n\n### 4. FedRAMP-Specific Considerations\n\n- **Boundary Documentation**: Clearly document the containerized system boundary, including:\n  - Which container images and orchestration components are part of the authorization boundary\n  - How containerized components interact with external systems\n  - Security responsibilities across the container technology stack\n\n- **Configuration Management**: Document how FedRAMP configuration management requirements are met in the container environment:\n  - How container images are versioned and tracked in the CM system\n  - How configuration changes to containers are managed and approved\n  - How container configurations are tested and validated\n\n- **Continuous Monitoring**: Document how continuous monitoring is implemented for containers:\n  - Runtime security monitoring of containers\n  - Container image scanning frequency and procedures\n  - Kubernetes security posture monitoring\n  - Integration with agency monitoring requirements\n\nBy implementing these cloud-native approaches to system documentation for SA-5, organizations can maintain comprehensive, accurate, and usable documentation for containerized applications while meeting FedRAMP requirements."

Organizations can apply systems security and privacy engineering principles to new systems under development or to systems undergoing upgrades. For existing systems, organizations apply systems security and privacy engineering principles to system upgrades and modifications to the extent feasible, given the current state of hardware, software, and firmware components within those systems.\n The application of systems security and privacy engineering principles helps organizations develop trustworthy, secure, and resilient systems and reduces the susceptibility to disruptions, hazards, threats, and the creation of privacy problems for individuals. Examples of system security engineering principles include: developing layered protections; establishing security and privacy policies, architecture, and controls as the foundation for design and development; incorporating security and privacy requirements into the system development life cycle; delineating physical and logical security boundaries; ensuring that developers are trained on how to build secure software; tailoring controls to meet organizational needs; and performing threat modeling to identify use cases, threat agents, attack vectors and patterns, design patterns, and compensating controls needed to mitigate risk.\n Organizations that apply systems security and privacy engineering concepts and principles can facilitate the development of trustworthy, secure systems, system components, and system services; reduce risk to acceptable levels; and make informed risk management decisions. System security engineering principles can also be used to protect against certain supply chain risks, including incorporating tamper-resistant hardware into a design.",

For services external to organizations, a chain of trust requires that organizations establish and retain a certain level of confidence that each provider in the consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for the services rendered. The extent and nature of this chain of trust vary based on relationships between organizations and the external providers. Organizations document the basis for the trust relationships so that the relationships can be monitored.

Configurations should be version-controlled, reviewed, tested, and deployed through automated pipelines.\n\n2. **Immutability Principle**:\n   Cloud-native applications follow the immutability principle, meaning containers and infrastructure components are not modified during their lifecycle. When changes are needed, new versions are built and deployed rather than modifying existing components. This simplifies configuration management but requires robust CI/CD pipelines.\n\n3. **Distributed Configuration Management**:\n   Cloud-native applications often consist of multiple microservices, each potentially with its own configuration requirements. This distributed nature requires cohesive configuration management practices across all components and careful consideration of dependencies between services.\n\n4. **Zero Trust Security Model**:\n   Cloud-native environments should implement zero trust principles where no component, user, or service is inherently trusted. This affects configuration management by requiring verification of all components through mechanisms like mutual TLS, signed artifacts, and policy enforcement at multiple points.\n\n5. **DevSecOps Integration**:\n   In cloud-native environments, security must be integrated throughout the development lifecycle. Configuration management must incorporate security validation at each stage rather than treating it as a separate activity. Automated security testing and validation must be built into CI/CD pipelines.\n\n6. **Kubernetes-Specific Considerations**:\n   When using Kubernetes, configuration management extends to:\n   - Custom Resources and Operators\n   - Admission Controllers for validating configurations\n   - Security Policies (Network Policies, Pod Security Policies)\n   - Service Mesh configurations for service-to-service communication\n   - Secrets management through native solutions or third-party tools\n\n7. **Supply Chain Security**:\n   The software supply chain in cloud-native environments is complex, with multiple dependencies and contributors. Configuration management must address the entire supply chain through techniques like:\n   - Signed artifacts and verification\n   - SBOM generation and verification\n   - Attestations for builds and dependencies\n   - Policy enforcement for artifact integrity\n\nThese contextual factors significantly expand the scope and complexity of developer configuration management in cloud-native environments, requiring a comprehensive approach that addresses both application code and infrastructure configurations through automated, secure pipelines."

Produce evidence of the execution of the assessment plan and the results of the testing and evaluation;\n d. Implement a verifiable flaw remediation process; and\n e. Correct flaws identified during testing and evaluation.\n\nNIST Discussion:\nDevelopmental testing and evaluation confirms that the required controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, enforcing the desired security and privacy policies, and meeting established security and privacy requirements. Security properties of systems and the privacy of individuals may be affected by the interconnection of system components or changes to those components. The interconnections or changes\u2014including upgrading or replacing applications, operating systems, and firmware\u2014may adversely affect previously implemented controls. Ongoing assessment during development allows for additional types of testing and evaluation that developers can conduct to reduce or eliminate potential flaws. Testing custom software applications may require approaches such as manual code review, security architecture review, and penetration testing, as well as and static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three analysis approaches.\n Developers can use the analysis approaches, along with security instrumentation and fuzzing, in a variety of tools and in source code reviews. The security and privacy assessment plans include the specific activities that developers plan to carry out, including the types of analyses, testing, evaluation, and reviews of software and firmware components; the degree of rigor to be applied; the frequency of the ongoing testing and evaluation; and the types of artifacts produced during those processes. The depth of testing and evaluation refers to the rigor and level of detail associated with the assessment process. The coverage of testing and evaluation refers to the scope (i.e., number and type) of the artifacts included in the assessment process. Contracts specify the acceptance criteria for security and privacy assessment plans, flaw remediation processes, and the evidence that the plans and processes have been diligently applied. Methods for reviewing and protecting assessment plans, evidence, and documentation are commensurate with the security category or classification level of the system. Contracts may specify protection requirements for documentation.",

It is most effective when used early in the development process, when each code change can automatically be scanned for potential weaknesses.

Evidence of the correct implementation of static analysis can include aggregate defect density for critical defect types, evidence that defects were inspected by developers or security professionals, and evidence that defects were remediated.

Training should similarly shift left, with developers receiving training on secure development practices early.\n   - Developers of cloud-native applications should provide training that enables security to be integrated throughout the DevSecOps pipeline, not just at deployment time.\n\n3. **Unique Kubernetes Training Requirements**:\n   - Kubernetes security is complex and multi-layered.

Training must address the increased attack surface and complexity.\n   - Service-to-service communication security is particularly important in microservices architectures and should be emphasized in developer-provided training.\n\n5. **Cultural Considerations**:\n   - NIST SP 800-190 notes that container adoption requires cultural adaptation. Training should address not just technical aspects but also the organizational mindset shift required for secure container operations.\n   - Training should prepare teams for the rapid iteration and immutability principles of cloud-native environments, which may differ significantly from traditional IT operations."

The distributed nature of containerized applications and CI/CD pipelines requires robust identity verification throughout the software development and deployment lifecycle.\n\n## 2. Container Trust Considerations\n\nContainer images represent an additional attack vector not present in traditional environments. Strong developer screening must be paired with container security controls to prevent unauthorized or malicious container deployment. This includes establishing a clear chain of custody for container images from development through production.\n\n## 3. Pipeline-based Enforcement\n\nCI/CD pipelines provide an opportunity to enforce developer screening requirements by validating credentials and authorizations at build time, rather than relying solely on initial personnel screening. This continuous verification approach is better suited to cloud-native environments with rapid deployment cycles.\n\n## 4. Kubernetes-Specific Controls\n\nKubernetes RBAC provides a mechanism to enforce developer access controls within the container orchestration platform. By mapping RBAC roles to official government duties and screening criteria, organizations can maintain proper authorization enforcement throughout the cluster.\n\n## 5.

If necessary, organizations can establish in-house support by developing customized patches for critical software components or, alternatively, obtain the services of external providers who provide ongoing support for the designated unsupported components through contractual relationships.

These functions typically require privileged user access. The separation of user functions from system management functions is physical or logical. Organizations may separate system management functions from user functions by using different computers, instances of operating systems, central processing units, or network addresses; by employing virtualization techniques; or some combination of these or other methods. Separation of system management functions from user functions includes web administrative interfaces that employ separate authentication methods for users of any other system resources. Separation of system and user functions may include isolating administrative interfaces on different domains and with additional access controls. The separation of system and user functionality can be achieved by applying the systems security engineering design principles in SA-8, including SA-8 (1), SA-8 (3), SA-8 (4), SA-8 (10), SA-8 (12), SA-8 (13), SA-8 (14), and SA-8 (18).",

The isolation boundary controls access to and protects the integrity of the hardware, software, and firmware that perform system security functions. Systems implement code separation in many ways, such as through the provision of security kernels via processor rings or processor modes. For non-kernel code, security function isolation is often achieved through file system protections that protect the code on disk and address space protections that protect executing code. Systems can restrict access to security functions using access control mechanisms and by implementing least privilege capabilities. While the ideal is for all code within the defined security function isolation boundary to only contain security-relevant code, it is sometimes necessary to include nonsecurity functions as an exception.

SP 800-189 provides additional information on source address validation techniques to prevent ingress and egress of traffic with spoofed addresses. Commercial telecommunications services are provided by network components and consolidated management systems shared by customers. These services may also include third party-provided access lines and other service elements. Such services may represent sources of increased risk despite contract security provisions. Boundary protection may be implemented as a common control for all or part of an organizational network such that the boundary to be protected is greater than a system-specific boundary (i.e., an authorization boundary).",

Operational Challenges\n\n- **Scale and Complexity**: The number of network boundaries increases dramatically in microservices architectures, requiring automated policy management and enforcement.\n\n- **Dynamic Environment**: Container orchestration creates a constantly changing network environment that requires dynamic policy enforcement rather than static rules.\n\n- **DevOps Integration**: Security teams must work closely with development teams to establish boundary controls that don't impede agility while maintaining security posture.\n\n## 3. FedRAMP-Specific Considerations\n\n- **Compliance Mapping**: Traditional FedRAMP boundary controls focused on network devices need to be translated to cloud-native constructs like network policies, service meshes, and API gateways.\n\n- **Shared Responsibility**: Clear documentation of the boundary protection responsibilities between CSP and agency is critical in containerized environments.\n\n- **Continuous Validation**: FedRAMP requires ongoing evidence of boundary effectiveness, necessitating robust monitoring and logging of container communications."

          "description": "Prevent split tunneling for remote devices connecting to organizational systems unless the split tunnel is securely provisioned using [Assignment: organization-defined safeguards].\n\nNIST Discussion:\nSplit tunneling is the process of allowing a remote user or device to establish a non-remote connection with a system and simultaneously communicate via some other connection to a resource in an external network. This method of network access enables a user to access remote devices and simultaneously, access uncontrolled networks. Split tunneling might be desirable by remote users to communicate with local system resources, such as printers or file servers. However, split tunneling can facilitate unauthorized external connections, making the system vulnerable to attack and to exfiltration of organizational information. Split tunneling can be prevented by disabling configuration settings that allow such capability in remote devices and by preventing those configuration settings from being configurable by users. Prevention can also be achieved by the detection of split tunneling (or of configuration settings that allow split tunneling) in the remote device, and by prohibiting the connection if the remote device is using split tunneling. A virtual private network (VPN) can be used to securely provision a split tunnel. A securely provisioned VPN includes locking connectivity to exclusive, managed, and named environments, or to a specific set of pre-approved addresses, without user control.",

System resources that may be requested include files, connections, web pages, or services. Client requests established through a connection to a proxy server are assessed to manage complexity and provide additional protection by limiting direct connectivity. Web content filtering devices are one of the most common proxy servers that provide access to the Internet. Proxy servers can support the logging of Transmission Control Protocol sessions and the blocking of specific Uniform Resource Locators, Internet Protocol addresses, and domain names. Web proxies can be configured with organization-defined lists of authorized and unauthorized websites. Note that proxy servers may inhibit the use of virtual private networks (VPNs) and create the potential for man-in-the-middle attacks (depending on the implementation).",

Techniques used to prevent the exfiltration of information from systems may be implemented at internal endpoints, external boundaries, and across managed interfaces and include adherence to protocol formats, monitoring for beaconing activity from systems, disconnecting external network interfaces except when explicitly needed, employing traffic profile analysis to detect deviations from the volume and types of traffic expected, call backs to command and control centers, conducting penetration testing, monitoring for steganography, disassembling and reassembling packet headers, and using data loss and data leakage prevention tools. Devices that enforce strict adherence to protocol formats include deep packet inspection firewalls and Extensible Markup Language (XML) gateways. The devices verify adherence to protocol formats and specifications at the application layer and identify vulnerabilities that cannot be detected by devices that operate at the network or transport layers. The prevention of exfiltration is similar to data loss prevention or data leakage prevention and is closely associated with cross-domain solutions and system guards that enforce information flow requirements.",

Configure keep-alive TLS connections for frequently interacting services to maintain session state while reducing overhead\n   - Use a service mesh implementation (like Istio, Linkerd) to manage and enforce mTLS across all microservices\n\n2. **API Gateway Configuration**\n   - Set up API Gateway as the primary entry point for external traffic with session protection mechanisms\n   - Implement token exchange services between gateways when using distributed gateway deployments, as described in NIST SP 800-204 (MS-SS-12)\n   - Configure the API Gateway to integrate with identity management systems and access token providers\n\n3. **Session Persistence Strategy**\n   - Follow NIST SP 800-204 (MS-SS-10) guidance: \"Session information for a client must be stored securely\"\n   - Protect artifacts used for conveying binding server information\n   - Ensure \"Internal authorization tokens must not be provided back to the user, and the user's session tokens must not be passed beyond the gateway for use in policy decisions\"\n\n### Microservices Architecture Considerations\n\n1. **Token-Based Session Management**\n   - Use short-lived (time-limited) JWT tokens with refresh token capability for maintaining sessions\n   - Implement claims validation during session establishment and throughout the session\n   - Enforce token verification at each microservice boundary\n   - Store session state in a distributed cache rather than in the token itself when sensitive information is involved\n\n2. **Service-to-Service Communication**\n   - Implement service identity verification for all internal service-to-service communications\n   - Use dedicated service accounts with well-defined roles and permissions for each microservice\n   - Configure session timeout policies that align with the overall security posture of the application\n\n3. **Stateless Design Principles**\n   - Design microservices to be stateless where possible, with session state stored in secure external systems\n   - Use distributed caching systems protected by encryption for shared session state\n   - Implement secure session propagation mechanisms when multiple microservices need to be involved in a transaction\n\n### DevSecOps Integration\n\n1. **Session Security Testing**\n   - Integrate session security testing into CI/CD pipelines\n   - Incorporate Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools that can verify session protection mechanisms\n   - Implement automated tests that verify session authenticity controls during the deployment process\n\n2. **Monitoring and Alerting**\n   - Configure security monitoring at both gateway and service levels to detect session authenticity issues\n   - Set up alerts for potential session hijacking attempts, as specified in NIST SP 800-204 (MS-SS-5)\n   - Monitor for replay attacks and unauthorized token reuse\n\n3. **Security Policy as Code**\n   - Define session authenticity requirements as policy code that can be automatically verified\n   - Implement security checks in CI/CD pipelines to validate session authenticity controls\n   - Create and maintain documentation on session protection mechanisms\n\n### Container Security Measures\n\n1. **Image Security**\n   - Use only verified and hardened container images from trusted registries\n   - Scan images for vulnerabilities that could compromise session authenticity\n   - Establish image signing and verification to maintain trusted container deployments\n\n2. **Runtime Protection**\n   - Implement runtime protection mechanisms to detect and prevent session hijacking attempts\n   - Configure network policies to prevent unauthorized lateral movement that could compromise sessions\n   - Use sidecar proxies (via service mesh) to manage and secure all session-related traffic\n\n3. **Secrets Management**\n   - Securely store and manage session-related secrets (keys, certificates) using dedicated secret management services\n   - Implement rotation policies for session-related cryptographic materials\n   - Leverage container orchestration platform's native secrets management capabilities\n\n### Cloud Provider Capabilities\n\n1. **Managed Security Services**\n   - Utilize cloud provider managed services for API gateways with built-in session protection features\n   - Implement cloud provider's managed certificate services for TLS/mTLS\n   - Use managed identity services for session authentication and authorization\n\n2. **Network Security Controls**\n   -

The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to system and information integrity policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.

Some types of flaw remediation may require more testing than other types. Organizations determine the type of testing needed for the specific type of flaw remediation activity under consideration and the types of changes that are to be configuration-managed.

Address the receipt of false positives during malicious code detection and eradication and the resulting potential impact on the availability of the system.\n\nNIST Discussion:\nSystem entry and exit points include firewalls, remote access servers, workstations, electronic mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, notebook computers, and mobile devices. Malicious code includes viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can also be encoded in various formats contained within compressed or hidden files or hidden in files using techniques such as steganography. Malicious code can be inserted into systems in a variety of ways, including by electronic mail, the world-wide web, and portable storage devices. Malicious code insertions occur through the exploitation of system vulnerabilities. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate the effects of malicious code.\n Malicious code protection mechanisms include both signature- and nonsignature-based technologies. Nonsignature-based detection mechanisms include artificial intelligence techniques that use heuristics to detect, analyze, and describe the characteristics or behavior of malicious code and to provide controls against such code for which signatures do not yet exist or for which existing signatures may not be effective. Malicious code for which active signatures do not yet exist or may be ineffective includes polymorphic malicious code (i.e., code that changes signatures when it replicates). Nonsignature-based mechanisms also include reputation-based technologies. In addition to the above technologies, pervasive configuration management, comprehensive software integrity controls, and anti-exploitation software may be effective in preventing the execution of unauthorized code. Malicious code may be present in commercial off-the-shelf software as well as custom-built software and could include logic bombs, backdoors, and other types of attacks that could affect organizational mission and business functions.\n In situations where malicious code cannot be detected by detection methods or technologies, organizations rely on other types of controls, including secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement processes, and monitoring practices to ensure that software does not perform functions other than the functions intended. Organizations may determine that, in response to the detection of malicious code, different actions may be warranted. For example, organizations can define actions in response to malicious code detection during periodic scans, the detection of malicious downloads, or the detection of maliciousness when attempting to open or execute files.",

Provide [Assignment: organization-defined system monitoring information] to [Assignment: organization-defined personnel or roles] [Selection (one or more): as needed; [Assignment: organization-defined frequency]].\n\nNIST Discussion:\nSystem monitoring includes external and internal monitoring. External monitoring includes the observation of events occurring at external interfaces to the system. Internal monitoring includes the observation of events occurring within the system. Organizations monitor systems by observing audit activities in real time or by observing other system aspects such as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives guide and inform the determination of the events. System monitoring capabilities are achieved through a variety of tools and techniques, including intrusion detection and prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring software, and network monitoring software.\n Depending on the security architecture, the distribution and configuration of monitoring devices may impact throughput at key internal and external boundaries as well as at other locations across a network due to the introduction of network throughput latency. If throughput management is needed, such devices are strategically located and deployed as part of an established organization-wide security architecture. Strategic locations for monitoring devices include selected perimeter locations and near key servers and server farms that support critical applications. Monitoring devices are typically employed at the managed interfaces associated with controls SC-7 and AC-17. The information collected is a function of the organizational monitoring objectives and the capability of systems to support such objectives. Specific types of transactions of interest include Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) traffic that bypasses HTTP proxies. System monitoring is an integral part of organizational continuous monitoring and incident response programs, and output from system monitoring serves as input to those programs. System monitoring requirements, including the need for specific types of system monitoring, may be referenced in other controls (e.g., AC-2g, AC-2 (7), AC-2 (12) (a), AC-17 (1), AU-13, AU-13 (1), AU-13 (2), CM-3f, CM-6d, MA-3a, MA-4a, SC-5 (3) (b), SC-7a, SC-7 (24) (b), SC-18b, SC-43b). Adjustments to levels of system monitoring are based on law enforcement information, intelligence information, or other sources of information. The legality of system monitoring activities is based on applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.",

For example, if the organization specifies that numerical values between 1-100 are the only acceptable inputs for a field in a given application, inputs of 387, abc, or %K% are invalid inputs and are not accepted as input to the system. Valid inputs are likely to vary from field to field within a software application. Applications typically follow well-defined protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed with metadata or control information. If software applications use attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages, then the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that receives the corrupted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly.

Cloud-Native Considerations\n\n- **Ephemeral vs. Persistent**: In cloud-native environments, there's a fundamental tension between the ephemeral nature of containers and the need for persistent information retention. Organizations must clearly distinguish between ephemeral runtime data and information requiring retention.\n\n- **Shared Responsibility Model**: Cloud providers typically handle infrastructure security while customers remain responsible for proper information management and retention. Clear documentation of responsibility boundaries is essential.\n\n- **Scaling Challenges**: As container deployments scale, information management becomes more complex. Automated policies and centralized management are critical for consistency.\n\n## 2. Regulatory Compliance Notes\n\n- **NARA Requirements**: The National Archives and Records Administration provides specific guidance on retention periods that must be incorporated into cloud-native information management strategies.\n\n- **Cross-Regulatory Alignment**: Information retention requirements may span multiple regulations (FedRAMP, HIPAA, GDPR, etc.). Cloud-native implementations should support configurable retention to address multiple compliance needs.\n\n- **Evidence Preservation**: Cloud-native environments must be configured to preserve evidence of compliance even when containers and infrastructure components are regularly replaced.\n\n## 3. Technical Implementation Challenges\n\n- **Stateless Preference**: Cloud-native architectures typically prefer stateless components, which can create challenges for information that requires retention. Clear separation of stateful components with appropriate retention controls is essential.\n\n- **CI/CD Integration**: Retention requirements must be integrated into rapid deployment pipelines to ensure that information is properly managed throughout its lifecycle.\n\n- **Container Immutability**: The immutable nature of containers can be leveraged for information integrity but requires careful planning for information that needs to be retained beyond container lifecycle.\n\n## 4. Best Practices\n\n- **\"Store Once, Use Many\"**: Centralize information storage to minimize duplication and simplify retention management.\n\n- **Automation First**: Leverage infrastructure as code and policy as code to automate retention enforcement.\n\n- **Zero Trust for Information Access**: Implement least privilege access to retained information regardless of where it's stored in the cloud-native environment.\n\n- **Regular Testing**: Conduct periodic tests of information recovery from backup/archived locations to verify retention effectiveness."

Therefore, it is important that security and privacy programs collaborate on the development of supply chain risk management policy and procedures. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level are preferable, in general, and may obviate the need for mission- or system-specific policies and procedures. The policy can be included as part of the general security and privacy policy or be represented by multiple policies that reflect the complex nature of organizations. Procedures can be established for security and privacy programs, for mission or business processes, and for systems, if needed. Procedures describe how the policies or controls are implemented and can be directed at the individual or role that is the object of the procedure. Procedures can be documented in system security and privacy plans or in one or more separate documents. Events that may precipitate an update to supply chain risk management policy and procedures include assessment or audit findings, security incidents or breaches, or changes in applicable laws, executive orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.

Review and update the supply chain risk management plan [Assignment: organization-defined frequency] or as required, to address threat, organizational or environmental changes; and\n c. Protect the supply chain risk management plan from unauthorized disclosure and modification.\n\nNIST Discussion:\nThe dependence on products, systems, and services from external providers, as well as the nature of the relationships with those providers, present an increasing level of risk to an organization. Threat actions that may increase security or privacy risks include unauthorized production, the insertion or use of counterfeits, tampering, theft, insertion of malicious software and hardware, and poor manufacturing and development practices in the supply chain. Supply chain risks can be endemic or systemic within a system element or component, a system, an organization, a sector, or the Nation. Managing supply chain risk is a complex, multifaceted undertaking that requires a coordinated effort across an organization to build trust relationships and communicate with internal and external stakeholders. Supply chain risk management (SCRM) activities include identifying and assessing risks, determining appropriate risk response actions, developing SCRM plans to document response actions, and monitoring performance against plans. The SCRM plan (at the system-level) is implementation specific, providing policy implementation, requirements, constraints and implications. It can either be stand-alone, or incorporated into system security and privacy plans. The SCRM plan addresses managing, implementation, and monitoring of SCRM controls and the development/sustainment of systems across the SDLC to support mission and business functions.\n Because supply chains can differ significantly across and within organizations, SCRM plans are tailored to the individual program, organizational, and operational contexts. Tailored SCRM plans provide the basis for determining whether a technology, service, system component, or system is fit for purpose, and as such, the controls need to be tailored accordingly. Tailored SCRM plans help organizations focus their resources on the most critical mission and business functions based on mission and business requirements and their risk environment. Supply chain risk management plans include an expression of the supply chain risk tolerance for the organization, acceptable supply chain risk mitigation strategies or controls, a process for consistently evaluating and monitoring supply chain risk, approaches for implementing and communicating the plan, a description of and justification for supply chain risk mitigation measures taken, and associated roles and responsibilities. Finally, supply chain risk management plans address requirements for developing trustworthy, secure, privacy-protective, and resilient system components and systems, including the application of the security design principles implemented as part of life cycle-based systems security engineering processes (see SA-8).",

The SCRM plan must address the rapid creation and deletion of resources rather than focusing only on long-lived infrastructure.\n   - Container images become critical supply chain components as they encapsulate multiple dependencies, making them potential targets for supply chain attacks.\n\n2. **Shifting From Perimeter to Workload Identity**\n   - Cloud-native security requires shifting from network perimeter controls to workload identity and behavioral validation. The SCRM plan should reflect this shift by focusing on container and service identity verification rather than network-based controls alone.\n\n3. **DevOps Integration Importance**\n   - In cloud-native environments, the developer experience is tightly integrated with operations. The SCRM plan must balance security controls with developer productivity to ensure adoption.\n   - Automated enforcement through policy-as-code is essential, as manual verification cannot scale to cloud-native deployment velocities.\n\n4. **Relevance to FedRAMP**\n   - FedRAMP requires agencies to maintain control over the security of the entire supply chain. For cloud-native applications, this extends to container registries, Kubernetes operators, and service mesh components that may not be considered in traditional supply chain plans.\n   - Cloud-native environments require specific attention to secure defaults and configurations as misconfiguration is a leading cause of security incidents.\n\n5. **Relationship to Other Controls**\n   - SR-2 forms the foundation for other Supply Chain Risk Management controls (SR-3, SR-9, SR-10, SR-11).\n   - Effective implementation requires coordination with configuration management (CM family), system and information integrity (SI family), and access control (AC family) controls.\n\nThe SCRM plan should be treated as a living document that evolves with the cloud-native ecosystem, incorporating new threats and mitigations as container orchestration technologies mature."

          "notes": "## 1. Cloud-Native Supply Chain Considerations\n\n### Container Image Layers\nContainer images introduce unique supply chain security challenges due to their layered structure. Each layer in a container image (base OS, dependencies, application code) represents a potential supply chain risk vector. Unlike traditional applications, container images combine multiple supply chain elements that must be secured.\n\n### Microservices Architecture Impact\nMicroservices architectures significantly increase the number of components in the supply chain. Each microservice may have its own dependencies, build pipeline, and deployment process. This requires more granular supply chain controls than monolithic applications, with particular attention to service-to-service communications.\n\n### CI/CD Integration Requirements\nCloud-native environments typically leverage automated CI/CD pipelines, which themselves become part of the supply chain. As noted in NIST SP 800-204D: \"Building a robust SSC security edifice requires various artifacts, such as a software bill of materials (SBOM) and frameworks for the attestation of software components\" (NIST SP 800-204D, Executive Summary).\n\n## 2. Implementation Challenges\n\n### Kubernetes-Specific Considerations\nKubernetes adds complexity to supply chain security due to its declarative approach and extensive API surface. Supply chain controls must address not only container images but also Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, operators, and custom resources.\n\n### Cloud Provider Dependencies\nCloud-native environments often rely on managed services from cloud providers, which introduces external dependencies into the supply chain. Organizations must incorporate cloud provider security controls into their overall supply chain risk management strategy.\n\n### Ephemeral Infrastructure Challenges\nThe dynamic nature of cloud-native infrastructure (containers being created and destroyed frequently) creates challenges for traditional supply chain controls. Evidence collection and verification must be automated and designed for ephemeral resources.\n\n## 3. Best Practices\n\nAccording to the NIST SP 800-204D guidance, implementing secure build processes is critical: \"Implement a secure build process to establish and maintain the integrity of build environment configurations and dependencies, source code, and resulting software\" (NIST SP 800-204D, Section 5.1.1).\n\nFrom the Supply Chain SR Controls Implementation transcript: \"Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs), dependency analysis reports, and digital signatures for software authenticity\" are essential for cloud-native supply chain security (Supply-Chain-SR-Controls-Implementation.md).\n\nThe CNCF Cloud Native Security Whitepaper emphasizes: \"The security of a system is only as good as the supply chain that it relies on. Defending the supply chain requires securing how software and hardware are designed, implemented, distributed, configured, stored, and verified.\" (CNCF_cloud-native-security-whitepaper-v2.md)."

There are many useful tools and techniques available, including obscuring the end use of a system or system component, using blind or filtered buys, requiring tamper-evident packaging, or using trusted or controlled distribution. The results from a supply chain risk assessment can guide and inform the strategies, tools, and methods that are most applicable to the situation. Tools and techniques may provide protections against unauthorized production, theft, tampering, insertion of counterfeits, insertion of malicious software or backdoors, and poor development practices throughout the system development life cycle. Organizations also consider providing incentives for suppliers who implement controls, promote transparency into their processes and security and privacy practices, provide contract language that addresses the prohibition of tainted or counterfeit components, and restrict purchases from untrustworthy suppliers. Organizations consider providing training, education, and awareness programs for personnel regarding supply chain risk, available mitigation strategies, and when the programs should be employed. Methods for reviewing and protecting development plans, documentation, and evidence are commensurate with the security and privacy requirements of the organization.

The procurement strategy should include Kubernetes-specific security tooling that integrates with the platform's security model.\n\n## 3.

Automation is critical, as manual security processes will be bypassed or circumvented. Tools that integrate security into CI/CD workflows without significantly impacting deployment speed are essential.\n\n## 4. Container Image Integrity Verification\n\nUnlike traditional application deployments, containers use layered filesystems where each layer can introduce vulnerabilities. Organizations should implement solutions that verify not just the final image but each layer in the image. This requires specialized tooling beyond traditional software integrity checks.\n\n## 5.

Container Image Signing and Verification\n\n- **Implement digital signatures for container images**: Use tools like Cosign, Notary, or cloud provider native solutions to cryptographically sign all container images as part of your CI/CD pipeline. This establishes a verifiable chain of custody for all images.\n  \n- **Configure admission controllers for verification**: Deploy Kubernetes admission controllers (such as OPA/Gatekeeper or Kyverno) to verify image signatures before allowing them to run in the cluster. Configure policies that reject any container without proper signatures.\n\n- **Establish trusted registries policy**: Define and enforce policies that only allow images from authorized, trusted container registries. Configure your Kubernetes clusters to reject images from unauthorized sources.\n\n- **Implement Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)**: Generate SBOMs for all container images that document all components and dependencies. Store these with your container images and verify them during the deployment process.\n\n### 2. CI/CD Pipeline Security Measures\n\n- **Secure build environments**: Isolate CI/CD build environments by project sensitivity level and implement strong access controls to prevent unauthorized modifications to the build process.\n\n- **Implement pipeline attestation**: Generate and sign metadata about your build pipeline processes. Use tools that provide cryptographic attestation of build activities, ensuring the provenance of your container images.\n\n- **Enforce build policies**: Implement policies in your CI/CD pipeline that validate component authenticity before proceeding with builds. This includes verifying the source of all dependencies.\n\n- **Protect signing keys**: Secure cryptographic signing keys using Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) or cloud key management services to prevent theft and misuse.\n\n### 3. Dependency and Component Management\n\n- **Implement dependency scanning**: Automatically scan all dependencies for known vulnerabilities and validate their authenticity against trusted sources prior to inclusion in builds.\n\n- **Verify source code packages**: Download open-source dependencies as source code rather than pre-compiled binaries when possible, and verify digital signatures before use.\n\n- **Establish allow lists for dependencies**: Create and maintain approved lists of trusted open-source components that meet your security requirements.\n\n- **Implement dependency pinning**: Pin dependencies to specific verified versions and hashes to prevent dependency confusion attacks.\n\n### 4. Runtime Detection of Counterfeit Components\n\n- **Deploy runtime security monitoring**: Implement container runtime security solutions to detect behavior indicative of counterfeit components or containers running unauthorized code.\n\n- **Conduct periodic integrity checks**: Regularly validate the integrity of running containers against their expected configurations and signatures.\n\n- **Implement container immutability**: Enforce container immutability to prevent runtime modifications that could introduce counterfeit components.\n\n### 5. Reporting Mechanisms\n\n- **Establish incident response procedures**: Create procedures for reporting discovered counterfeit components to appropriate internal teams, vendors, and external reporting organizations (such as CISA).\n\n- **Implement automated alerting**: Configure automated alerts when unverified or potentially counterfeit components are detected during build, deployment, or runtime.\n\n- **Document chain of custody**: Maintain audit logs of all image building, signing, and deployment activities to establish a verifiable chain of custody for all software components.",

          "notes": "## Cloud-Native Considerations for SR-11\n\n### Container Ecosystem Complexities\n\nIn cloud-native environments, the component supply chain is significantly more complex than in traditional systems. A single container image may include hundreds of dependencies from various sources, increasing the risk surface for counterfeit components. The ephemeral and automated nature of cloud-native deployments makes constant verification essential.\n\n### Microservices Architecture Implications\n\nMicroservices architectures break applications into numerous small, independently deployable services. This amplifies the need for robust component authenticity verification as the number of deployable components increases dramatically. Each microservice may have its own dependencies and build process, requiring consistent authentication mechanisms across all services.\n\n### DevSecOps Integration\n\nIntegrating component authenticity checks into automated CI/CD pipelines is essential in cloud-native environments. Manual verification is impractical given the frequency of deployments in DevOps workflows. Authentication mechanisms must work within existing automation without introducing significant delays.\n\n### Container Image Considerations\n\nContainer images present unique challenges for component authenticity. Images are layered, with base images often pulled from public registries. Each layer introduces potential risks. Cloud-native component authenticity measures must account for the layered nature of containers and verify the authenticity of all layers.\n\n### Cloud Provider Capabilities\n\nCloud providers offer native services that can assist with component authenticity verification, such as container registry scanning, binary authorization, and key management services. Organizations should leverage these cloud-native capabilities while ensuring their component authenticity strategies remain portable across cloud environments.\n\n### Shared Responsibility Model\n\nIn cloud-native deployments, the responsibility for component authenticity is shared between the cloud provider and the organization. While cloud providers secure their infrastructure, organizations remain responsible for verifying the authenticity of their application components, container images, and dependencies.\n\nBy implementing these cloud-native specific measures for SR-11, organizations can effectively detect and prevent counterfeit components from entering their systems while maintaining the speed and agility benefits of cloud-native architectures."

Opportunities for compromise during disposal affect physical and logical data, including system documentation in paper-based or digital files; shipping and delivery documentation; memory sticks with software code; or complete routers or servers that include permanent media, which contain sensitive or proprietary information.

Data Sanitization in Cloud-Native Systems\n\n- **Persistent Storage**:\n  - For PersistentVolumes containing sensitive data, implement pre-deletion hooks that execute secure data wiping operations\n  - Use storage class configurations that support secure deletion/cryptographic erasure for cloud provider volumes\n  - For critical data, implement multi-step sanitization by overwriting storage with random patterns before deletion\n\n- **Ephemeral Storage**:\n  - Configure containers to use ephemeral storage options (emptyDir in Kubernetes) for sensitive temporary data\n  - Implement memory clearing operations in application shutdown hooks for containers with sensitive in-memory data\n  - Use seccomp profiles to restrict write operations to authorized paths only\n\n- **Cryptographic Techniques**:\n  - Implement data-at-rest encryption using FIPS 140-validated cryptographic modules with key disposal mechanisms\n  - Use cryptographic erasure (deleting encryption keys) for cloud storage when physical media sanitization isn't possible\n  - Rotate encryption keys regularly and securely dispose of old keys\n\n### 3. Cloud Provider-Specific Considerations\n\n- **Shared Responsibility**:\n  - Document shared responsibility boundaries for component disposal between your organization and the cloud provider\n  - Request and maintain cloud provider attestations for media sanitization practices\n  - For FedRAMP compliance, ensure cloud providers follow NIST SP 800-88 guidelines for media sanitization\n\n- **Infrastructure as Code**:\n  - Use declarative infrastructure-as-code approaches to enable consistent, documented destruction of resources\n  - Implement automated teardown procedures that include secure disposal steps for sensitive components\n  - Create disposal policies for infrastructure components that include verification steps\n\n### 4.

Cloud-Native Disposal Challenges\n\n- **Ephemeral Nature**: Unlike traditional systems, containers are designed to be ephemeral, which creates unique challenges for ensuring complete data disposal since normal container termination may not trigger proper data sanitization procedures.\n\n- **Persistent Storage Complexities**: In cloud-native architectures, persistent storage often spans multiple abstraction layers (container volumes, storage classes, cloud provider block storage), requiring disposal procedures at each layer.\n\n- **Shared Infrastructure**: Cloud-native environments typically run on shared infrastructure, which introduces risk that sensitive data could be exposed to other tenants without proper disposal techniques.\n\n### 2. Architectural Considerations\n\n- **Microservices Implications**: Microservice architectures distribute data and functionality across many small services, increasing the complexity of tracking all components that require disposal and ensuring complete removal.\n\n- **Stateless Design**: While cloud-native applications often aim for statelessness, stateful services still exist and require special attention for component disposal, especially for databases and message queues containing sensitive information.\n\n- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes and other orchestrators create additional abstraction layers that must be considered in disposal procedures, including pod volumes, ConfigMaps, and Secrets.\n\n### 3. Emerging Practices\n\n- **GitOps for Disposal**: Organizations are increasingly adopting GitOps workflows that include explicit component disposal as part of the application lifecycle, providing better tracking and auditability of disposal actions.\n\n- **Immutable Infrastructure**: The trend toward immutable infrastructure (where components are replaced rather than updated) simplifies some aspects of disposal by creating clear component lifecycles but requires robust automation.\n\n- **Disposal Validation**: New tools are emerging that can validate the effectiveness of disposal procedures through automated testing and verification of resource removal across cloud environments.\n\n### 4. Security Implications\n\n- **Supply Chain Considerations**: Container base images and dependencies represent supply chain components that require careful disposal when vulnerabilities are discovered to prevent reintroduction into the environment.\n\n- **Regulatory Context**: Cloud-native component disposal must satisfy multiple regulatory frameworks (FedRAMP, NIST, etc.) that may have differing requirements for what constitutes proper disposal.\n\n- **Data Sovereignty**: Multi-cloud and multi-region deployments introduce data sovereignty requirements that impact disposal procedures, potentially requiring region-specific approaches to component disposal."
